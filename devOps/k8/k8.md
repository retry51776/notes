## Things Cloud Providers make easier
- IAM `cloud provider already have buildin IAM w nice interface, keycloak is opensource alt w a lot work to setup`
- External Loadbalancer for K8 `cloud have custom loadbalancer assign public ip, alt is MetalLB`
- Logging `all clouds have buildin logging, so many logs alternative but more work to setup, Kibana ELK?`
- Fancy UI way better than any extension


## Analogy
> **External Loadbalancer:** Public road entry
> 
> Ingress(Shopping Mall) VS LoadBalancer(Shopping Plaza)
> 
> Ingress Rule(Shop inside Mall) have limited support traffic
> 
> Shopping Plaza(Shop in Plaza) each have their own doors, able to handle more traffic, in cost of expensive construction

```bash
# Scripts verbs
kubectl [create|edit|get|delete]

kubectl config view
# Default Config Paths
# export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/new-config
# ~/.kube/config or /Users/<user_name>/.kube/config
```
- config `store contexts, where cluster, who is user, ca,`
- job
- cronjob `https://crontab.guru/`
- deployment `Add deployment_strategy, Pros,... on top ReplicaSet, `
- ReplicaSet (RS) `a very basic unit k8 start pods`
- pods `smalleset k8 unit`
- service `exposed to other k8 services`
- ingress `exposed to vpn`
- event
- secrets
- configMap

## K8 CMD
```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mycronjob name-of-one-off-job
kubectl run XXXX --images=XXXX --port=80  
kubectl exec -it pod-name sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment xyz
kubectl rollout undo deployment myapp
kubectl rollout history deploy myapp --revision=2

# Almost never do this in Production 
kubectl expose deployment XXXX --type="LoadBalancer" service "XXXX" exposed  

# Show all process
ps auxww 
```

> containerD and cri-o are container runtime

> open container initiative

## K8 components:
- Mater Node
  - Scheduler
    - Trigger Cron Jobs
  - Control Mgr
    - Compare Active State vs Desired State
  - etcd
    - key/value DB
  - API service
    - Supports cmds
- Worker Node
  - Container Run Time
    - Pods //smallest k8 unit
  - Kubproxy
    - route & selector
  - Kubelet
    - communicate with API-service

## Node Components
- kubelet
  1. Scheduled: assign pod to node
  2. Pull: pull image
  3. Start: start pod
- kube-proxy
  1. manage iptables rules by Service def
  2. Internal DNS & load balancer
- container runtime
  - CRI-O
  - containerd (cri-dockerd)
  - docker (dockershim)
  - mirantis Container Runtime
- cri-dockerd
  > Container_Runtime <- Container  Runtime Interface <- kubelet <- - API_Service

# Deployment File
> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/


# K8 Networking
> Container Network Interface (CNI) default Calico-node

> The container runtime offloads the IP assignment to CNI

> IP-per-Pod is each Pod receiving a unique IP address

> container within same pod connect through localhost

> Services, complex encapsulations of network routing rule definitions stored in iptables on cluster nodes and implemented by kube-proxy agents. 

### Install tools
- kubeadm `Install production k8`
- kubespray/kargo (base off Ansible)
- kops

- minikube `Full k8 single cluster single node`
- kind `Run k8 in docker`
- k3s `not common`

### kubenete dashboard
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.5.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml

kubectl proxy

kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard -n default
kubectl create clusterrolebinding dashboard-admin -n default --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:dashboard
kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount dashboard -o jsonpath="{ secrets[0].name}") -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode
```


Examples of controllers are Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, etc.
DaemonSets enforce single pod per node on all nodes (for monitor logs, storage, network)
ReplicaSet is outdated

#### VM Driver
- podman
- virtualbox

Normal Users manage by independent services like User/Client Certificates
Service Accounts communicate with the API server to perform various operations.

`sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yamml /kube-apiserver-backup`
just add extra param
takes 20-40 seconds for api-server restart


The user/client now connects to a Service via its ClusterIP, which forwards traffic to one of the Pods attached to it. A Service provides load balancing by default while selecting the Pods for traffic forwarding.

Service.targetPort = Pod.spec.containerPort

Service's endpoints is auto created by k8, Ex:(10.1.1.1:5000, 10.1.1.2:5000)
can I manually test Service's endpoints? 10.1.1.1:5000

Traffic police
Local: exposed to only same node

my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local


## Volume Type
- emptyDir // deleted after POD dead
- hostPath // exists after POD dead. on node?
- cephfs
- nfs
- iscsi
- secret
  - secret data `must be base64`
  - stringData `is string`
- configMap
- persistentVolumeClaim(PVC)


### Cloud volumns
- gcePersistentDisk // GCP
- awsElasticBlockStore
- azureDisk
- azureFile


## Job
- parallelism - `to set the number of pods allowed to run in parallel;`
- completions - `to set the number of expected completions;`
- activeDeadlineSeconds - `to set the duration of the Job;`
- backoffLimit - `to set the number of retries before Job is marked as failed;`
- ttlSecondsAfterFinished - `to delay the clean up of the finished Jobs.`

## CronJobs
- startingDeadlineSeconds - `to set the deadline to start a Job if scheduled time was missed;`
- concurrencyPolicy - `to allow or forbid concurrent Jobs or to replace old Jobs with new ones. `

### Service Mesh Addons:
- Consul
- Envoy
- Istio
- Kuma
- Linkerd
- Maesh
- Tanzu Service Mesh

Advance Deployement
Canary - 2 different version at same time
Blue/Green - Completed switch over
> Create another service with selector able select both version PODs

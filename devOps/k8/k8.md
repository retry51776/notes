> define Secret before RoleBind, Service before Deployment


## Things Cloud Providers make easier
- IAM `cloud provider already have buildin IAM w nice interface, self host k8 needs self manage auth by cert or service_account_token`
- External Loadbalancer for K8 `cloud have custom loadbalancer assign public ip, alt is MetalLB`
- Logging `all clouds have buildin logging, so many logs alternative but more work to setup, Kibana ELK?`
- Fancy UI way better than any extension
- Better Ingress `At least GKE's traefik is better`


## Analogy
> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nOuYvXbQCjM_c869Mfyv59xfz-2f_QE4K1d0dUQQc4k/edit?usp=sharing

> **External Loadbalancer** (Public Street Entry)
>
> **namespace** (Section of Mall) `Group for k8s resources, allow Role to grant permission`
> 
> **network police** (Elevator) `One/Both way traffic control, help secure section of mall.`
> 
> **Cluster** (Shopping Mall) `Shopping Mall without parking lot, customers needs to walk into store`
> 
> **Node** (Building) `Shopping Mall can have only 1 building, or multi building connected together`
> 
> **Pods** (Area inside Shopping Mall Building) `can be [store/app deployment, hallway/loadbalancer, service area/job], Mall mgr able to scale multiple, or move store between building; Area by default is boarded up, to access must create door)`
> 
>> **Container** (SubArea inside Area) `Pod can have multi containers running, but they shares same area/ram, electricity/cpu`
>>
>> **Probs** (Construction Signs) `indicator Area is still remodeling or ready`

>> **Daemonset** (Building requirements) `Ex: every building should basic utilities: emergency exit, information desk, hallway, bathrooms. Similar Node requires logging, traffic control, metric, disk mount`
>
>> **Deployment** (Chain Stores) `do/sell same thing, cooperate usually keep at least couple in each mall. scale dependence on traffic, allow multi stores in same building, or none in any building.`
>
>> **Naked Pod** (Mom & Pop Store) `do its own thing, none to restart when it closed`


> **Api Server** (Mall mgr)
>> **etcd** Mall mgr's notebook
>
>> **Controller, Scheduler** (Assistant of Mall mgr) `Controller decide, maintain service, auth; Scheduler check probs, where pods`
>
>> **kubelet** (Building mgr) `Listen to Mall mgr direction; As owner you can directly request Building mgr too.`
>
>> **kubeproxy** (Information Desk) `part of guide system`

> **Service** (Map of Mall) `part of guide system, 3 types(LoadBalancer, NodePort, ClusterIP)`
> 
> Endpoint (Store Number) `Property of Service; each store have its own unique number, Ex: Subway have 3 stores in Mall [x.x.x.1:3000, x.x.x.2:3000, x.x.x.3:3000]`
> 
>> 1. **LoadBalancer Service** (Entry Point) `Where customer go into mall, able to handle more traffic, in cost of expensive construction`
>>> **Ingress Service** (Hallway Entry) 
>>>> **Ingress Controller** (Hallway) `The place where we direct customers to stores(ClusterIP Service), recommend to be daemonset(similar to each building should have its own hallway)`
>>>>> **Ingress Rule** (Hallway Direction) `How we route customers to Stores; layer 7 Application & layer 4 Transport`
>>
>>> **LoadBalancer Service** (Conner Store Entry) `Coner Store(Ex: public UI, API) expects a lot traffic will needs its own door(public access)`
>> 
>> 2. **NodePort Service** (Service Door of Store in Shopping Mall) `allow developer testing, usually not use in production`
>> 
>> 3. **ClusterIP Service** (Store Door inside Shopping Mall) `have smaller limited traffic support`

# Workflow:
1. Authentication     [cert, token]
2. Authorization      [RBAC, verb, resource, apigroup, namespace]
3. Mutating webhook   (optional)
4. AdmissionReview    
5. Validating webhook (optional)
6. Lock etcd          (only on edit)
7. Edit etcd          (only on edit)
8. api_service watch trigger kube-scheduler 
9. kube-scheduler -> kube-controller -> kubelet `to assign new Pod on some Node w enough resources`
10. kubelet send Container Runtime Interface (CRI) request
11. Container Runtime Interface (CRI) calls Container Network Interface(CNI), assign IP for pod
12. Container Network Interface(CNI) call Container Runtime create POD

## Objects / Resources / Manifests
> resources types: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types
> 
> custom resource definition (CRD) since k8 1.7
>
> annotations is NOT used by selector, selector = label
>
> apiversions value dependence on Kind, check here:
>
> https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/articles/kubernetes-apiversion-definition-guide.html
>
> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/

> Examples of controllers are Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, etc.
>
> multi control loop & operator(custom control loop, Ex: MySQL Operator)
>
- config `store contexts, where cluster, who is user, ca,`
- cronjob `https://crontab.guru/`
- daemonset `similar to deployment, but every node have 1; good for logging, ingress controller,`
- deployment `Add deployment_strategy, Pros,... on top ReplicaSet, `
- ReplicaSet (RS) `a very basic unit k8 start pods`
- pods `smallest k8 unit`
- service `exposed to other k8 services, append records into service registry`
- ingress `exposed to vpn`
- event `api_service only store 1hr events`
- secrets
- configMap
- persistentVolume(pv) `where folder is`
- persistentVolumeClaim (pvc) `mount to pod, lock system avoid multi pod mount same pv`
- ResourceQuota `apply to namespace to limit CPU & RAM`

## Ingress
> ingress is K8 route controller, by default is nginx, alt is nginx+(Dashboard, LB methods, sess persistance, health check, JWT validation), or traefik, HAProxy https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/

### Ingress Types:
- Single Service
- Simple Fanout
- Name-based virtual hosting
  
## K8 components:
[K8s diagram](../../static/kubernetes_architecture.png)

## Node Components
- kubelet
  1. Scheduled: assign pod to node
  2. Pull: pull image
  3. Start: start pod
- kube-proxy
  1. manage iptables rules by Service def
  2. Internal DNS & load balancer
- container runtime
  - CRI-O
  - containerd (cri-dockerd)
  - docker (dockershim)
  - mirantis Container Runtime
- cri-dockerd


# K8 Networking
> Container Network Interface (CNI) default Calico-node, not install

> The container runtime offloads the IP assignment to CNI

> IP-per-Pod is each Pod receiving a unique IP address

> container within same pod connect through localhost

> Services, complex encapsulations of network routing rule definitions stored in iptables on cluster nodes and implemented by kube-proxy agents. 

> containerD and cri-o are container runtime

> application layer encryption for secrets

> service mesh

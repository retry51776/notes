# Principal & Framework
> Inspired by Ray Dalio book; Here are my general principals & frameworks.


# Framework

## Life is a video game
> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.


## [**Psychology**](./psychology.md)
Forward Propagation Workflow
> **Attention** > Sensation > **Perception** > **Association** > Action

Backward Propagation Workflow
> Result > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Implementation

Assets
> **Skills** are learned tools or behavior. `Procedural Memory`
>
> **Principals** are common rule across many skills
>
> **Frameworks** are collection of principals.
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
> 
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
> 
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](./framework.md)
>
> **Personal Value** is statistical bias from the past. 
> > It's hard to change because it require a lot to dilute denominator.


> Problem / [Assets] = [**Choice**](#encounter-problem) 
> > Encounter problem, your [action](#action) dependence on what **Assets** you possess


# Principal
- 4 choice handle problem
> 1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.
> 2. Change path to avoid problem.
> 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
> 4. Get others resolve problem for you.

- Pain + Reflection = Progress
> Mistake indices there is a problem; It's up to player which 1 out of 4 ways to handle it.
>> If you choose #3; You may unlock a game equipment`principle, skill, money, or lesson`; It's up to you to collect`or not collect` this new equipment
>
>> Principle has different level, you can **REFINE** principle to get better principle; Or keep using level 1 principle`early child conclusion` you collected; 

- Everything has its mechanic;
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.

- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.
> Everything cost something.

- Great power comes great responsibility`spider-man`
> IMO: Most people problem is they want power `money, position` without responsibility;
> 
> It's easy envy rich, because you did't pay its responsibility`cost`.

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;


# Recognize Pattern
- Most things have recursive property
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict;
> Solution/Hack around by delay response`aka cool off period`;

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you
> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Top down view VS bottom up view

- Intelligence also equilibrium of supply`often too much focus` and demand`often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue
> The reason for Brand, Company, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.


# Personal Value
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.
- Repetition training is most effective way to change.
- Change your path is easier than change what your desire.

# Common Judgement
- When leader w strong ego, their ability is ceiling of their team.


# Action
> aka: Action > Result > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Implementation
- choice 1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.


- choice 2. Avoid problem.
  - 2.1 Change path without change desires
  - 2.2 Change path & desires


- choice 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
  - 3.1 listen other | observe problem
    - 3.1.1 bad decision `already know what went wrong`
      - missing knowledge;
      - lack of training;
      - improve process design;
    - 3.1.2 missing skill `have an idea of what need to learn`
      - lack of motivation;
      - lack of resource;
    - 3.1.3 psychology problem `root to multiple problems`
      - attention?
      - association?
        - personal bias? `dilute bias`
        - unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`
      - perception? `what you don't noticed? Can you practice to improve perception?`
      - sensation? `i can't fix blind; any work around?`
  - 3.2 validate problem
    - 3.2.1 can you reproduce problem?
    - 3.2.2 can you limited variables?
    - 3.2.3 can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
  - 3.3 communication
    - 3.3.1 If any one using reptilian brain, delay communication
    - 3.3.2 Establish connection by confirm their feeling, share your feeling
  - 3.4 design solution
    - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember compromise
    - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement
  - 3.5 training
    - 3.5.1 repeatation is the key
  - 3.6 explore alternative
    - 3.6.1 what if?
  - 3.7 conclusion
    - 3.7.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson
    - 3.7.2 Other subject/problem have inspiration from new conclusion
    - 3.7.2 Add conclusion to log
  - 3.8 develop trust
    - 3.8.1 Trust yourself to resolve problem
    - 3.8.2 Other trust you to resolve problem


- choice 4. Get others resolve problem for you.
  - 4.1 Reliance on others
  - 4.2 Observe & go to #3

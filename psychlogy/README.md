# Workflow
> Here is my desire workflow / process / framework / standardized system. `IDK what is best name for it.`
> 
> Workflow is design on top of [**Psychology**](./psychology.md)
>
> Inspired by Ray Dalio's Principal;

## **Central Nervous System Workflow**
Forward Propagation Workflow `aka decision process`

> [Desire](#desire) > Problem > [**Awareness**](#awareness) > [**Association**](./psychology.md#4-association) > [**Action**](#action)


Backward Propagation Workflow `aka reflection process`
> Result > [Evaluation](#action) > [Diagnosis](#diagnose) > [Design](#design) > [Implementation](#implementation)

<hr>

> **Desire**, **Awareness**, **Knowledge** are key elements to control workflow.
## Desire
> There is a natural psychological desire within us to belong and have power.

## Awareness
> Awareness can break down to [**Attention**](./psychology.md#1-attention) > [Sensation](./psychology.md#2-sensation) > [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception)


## Knowledge
> Knowledge is accumulate state `RNN hidden state` of CNS Workflow;

- Knowledge without training
> [**Memory & Emotion**](./psychology.md#emotion--memory-association) includes Working Memory & Long Term Memory & Emotion.
> 
> [**Conclusion**](#conclusion) is recognized pattern derived from past observation `[Problem > Action > Result]`.
> > It's difficult to change our conclusion because it's based on many different results, which makes it hard to dilute the existing conclusion.
>
> > We are always be `bias` because we all only experiences subset of realities.
> 
> > Conclusion is guidance for action.
> 
> [**Personal Value**](#personal-value) `aka KPI for evaluation` are ways we evaluate the internal & external action & result.
> > It is rare for individuals to change their personal values because these values are typically developed during early childhood.
> 
> > The new personal value require compatibility with existing personal value & conclusion.

- Knowledge requires training
> **Skills** are learned [**Actions**](#action);
> > Procedural Memory. Most people able obtain.

> [**Principals**](#principal) are common used algorithm support/explain [**conclusion**](#conclusion); `Metaphor: algorithms transform unknown function into known function`
> > Principal won't have conflict w other principals `under some premises`.
>
> [**Frameworks**](#framework) are collection of principals to explain reality. `aka mental construction of reality.`
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
> 
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
> 
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](./framework.md)
> 
> > It is rare, but sometime new framework to lead to the development of new personal values.

# Personal Value
> It's recommend you prioritize your top 10 Personal Values & live by it.
> 
> Living by your value makes you happier, more confidence on your decision, give direction to your life.

# Conclusion
`aka Recognized patterns.`

- All knowledge build on top assumptions, aware assumption can be invalidated.

- Everything has its mechanic.
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.
> Everything cost something.

- Great power comes great responsibility. `from spider-man`
> IMO: Most people problem is they want power `money, position` without responsibility;
> 
> Parenting should base on equal respect; Make kid understand more power comes with more responsibility.

- Most things have recursive property.
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict.
> Hack around by delay response. `aka cool off period`

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you
> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Intelligence is equilibrium of supply `often too much focus` and demand `often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue
> The reason for Brand, Company, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.


# Principal
`aka belief/goal/guidance/assumption.`

`Self-Guidance principals:`
- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.

- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.
> Connection before correction. `by Jane Nelsen`
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
> Most people happy when they have new ability.
> 
> That's why kid way happier than adult, kid unlock new ability more frequents than adult.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.
> Change your path is easier than change what your desire.

- Repetition training is most effective way to change. `Not talking about memory, just habits.`

- Pain + Reflection = Progress
> Mistake indices there is a problem; It's up to player which 1 out of 4 [actions](#action) to handle it.
>> If you choose #3; You may unlock a game equipment`principle, skill, money, or lesson`; It's up to you to collect`or not collect` this new equipment
>
>> Principle has different level, you can **REFINE** principle to get better principle; Or keep using level 1 principle`early child conclusion` you collected;

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;

`Team work principals:`
- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.

- Establish goal & rule in advanced, and transparent environment.

- Better workflow is more valuable than correct answer.
> Most parent mistakes root from parent value correct behavior OVER child's psychology workflow.
>
> Don't go for perfect answer. Rather focus on constance improvement of existing workflow.


- 2 approaches to solution
> Top down approach
> > List possible causes, then start eliminate causes by logic.
> 
> Bottom up approach
> > Start from what I can do, build a module at a time, then start combine module.

- When leader w strong ego, leader's ability is ceiling of their team.


## Framework
> Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.

> aka: Problem > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Action
- Evaluation 1. Do nothing.
  - 1.1 Don't recognized problem.
  - 1.2 Ignore problem.


- Evaluation 2. Avoid problem.
  - 2.1 Change path
  - 2.2 Change desires


- Evaluation 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
  ### Diagnose
  - 3.1 Diagnose `listen other; reexamine knowledge`
    - 3.1.1 [attention?](psychology.md#1-attention)
      - improve workflow design;
      - more workflow training;
    - 3.1.2 [sensation?](psychology.md#2-sensation)
      - any work around? `i can't fix blind`
    - 3.1.3 [perception?](./psychology.md#3-perception)
      - biology perception?
        - `idk fix, work around?`

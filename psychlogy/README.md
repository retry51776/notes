# Workflow
> Here is my desire workflow, process, standardized system. `IDK what is best name for it.`
> 
> Workflow is design on top of [**Psychology**](./psychology.md)
>
> Inspired by Ray Dalio's Principal;

## **Central Nervous System Workflow**
Forward Propagation Workflow `aka decision process`

>Problem > [**Attention**](./psychology.md#1-attention) > [Sensation](./psychology.md#2-sensation) > [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception) > [**Association**](./psychology.md#4-association) > [**Action**](#action)
> > Association find relevant [**Knowledge**](#knowledge) of problem, Knowledge determents your [**Action**](#action)
>  >1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.
>  >2. Change path to avoid problem.
>  >3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
>  >4. Get others resolve problem for you.
> 
> > Note: Rational Logic is subset of knowledge.


Backward Propagation Workflow `aka reflection process`
> Result > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Implementation

### Knowledge
> Knowledge is byproduct`RNN hidden state` of Workflow;
> 
> Knowledge includes skills, principals, frameworks, and personal value;

Default Knowledge `aka most people know by default`
- [Problem > Action > Result] > Pattern > Personal Value
> **Pattern** extract from observable past **action** & **result**.
> 
> **Personal value** is statistical bias `aka pattern` from the past action & result.
> > Hard to change personal value because value require many different Results to dilute existing denominator.
>
> > We are always be `bias` because we all only experiences subset of realities.

None Default Knowledge `requires training`
> **Skills** are learned [**Actions**](#action); `aka copy answer for problem`
> > Procedural Memory. Most people able obtain.
>
> [**Principals**](#principal) are patterns across many skills; `aka workflow/rule of how to make answer`
> > Principal won't have conflict w other principals `under some premises`.
> 
> > Principal is guide for action.
>
> [**Frameworks**](#framework) are collection of principals. `aka understanding of problems`
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
> 
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
> 
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](./framework.md)
> 
> > Understanding Framework will change personal value like distribution able calculate median point;


# Principal
- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
- All knowledge build on top assumptions, aware assumption can be invalidated.

- Everything has its mechanic.
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.
> Everything cost something.

- Great power comes great responsibility. `spider-man`
> IMO: Most people problem is they want power `money, position` without responsibility;
> 
> Parenting should base on equal respect; Make kid understand more choices comes with more responsibility.

- Establish goal & rule in advanced, and transparent environment.


# Recognize Pattern
- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.
- Most people happy when they have new ability.
> That's why kid way happier than adult, kid unlock new ability more frequents than adult.

- Pain + Reflection = Progress
> Mistake indices there is a problem; It's up to player which 1 out of 4 ways to handle it.
>> If you choose #3; You may unlock a game equipment`principle, skill, money, or lesson`; It's up to you to collect`or not collect` this new equipment
>
>> Principle has different level, you can **REFINE** principle to get better principle; Or keep using level 1 principle`early child conclusion` you collected; 

- Most things have recursive property.
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict;
> Solution/Hack around by delay response`aka cool off period`;

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you
> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Intelligence also equilibrium of supply`often too much focus` and demand`often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue
> The reason for Brand, Company, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.

- When leader w strong ego, their ability is ceiling of their team.

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;

- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.

- Repetition training is most effective way to change.

- Change your path is easier than change what your desire.

- 2 approaches to solution
> Top down approach
> > List possible causes, then start eliminate causes by logic.
> 
> Bottom up approach
> > Start from what I can do, build a module at a time, then start combine module.

- Better workflow is more valuable than correct answer.
> Most parent mistakes root from parent value correct behavior OVER child's psychology workflow.
>
> Don't go for perfect answer. Rather focus on constance improvement of existing workflow.

## Framework
> Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.




# Action
> aka: Action > Result > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Implementation
- choice 1. Do nothing.
  - 1.1 Because don't recognized problem.
  - 1.2 Because ignore problem.


- choice 2. Avoid problem.
  - 2.1 Change path without change desires
  - 2.2 Change path & desires


- choice 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
  - 3.1 listen other | observe problem
    - 3.1.1 bad decision `aka attention problem`
      - improve workflow design;
      - more workflow training;
    - 3.1.2 missing knowledge `have an idea of what need to learn`
      - get motivation;
      - get resource;
    - 3.1.3 deeper psychology problem `root to multiple problems`
      - association?
        - personal bias? `dilute bias`
        - unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`
      - perception? `what you don't noticed? Can you practice to improve perception?`
      - sensation? `i can't fix blind; any work around?`
  - 3.2 validate problem
    - 3.2.1 can you reproduce problem?
    - 3.2.2 can you limited variables?
    - 3.2.3 can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
  - 3.3 communication
    - 3.3.1 If any one using reptilian brain, delay communication
    - 3.3.2 Establish connection by confirm their feeling, share your feeling
  - 3.4 design workflow
    - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember compromise
    - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement

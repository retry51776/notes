# Principal & Framework
> Inspired by Ray Dalio book; Here are my general principals & frameworks.

# Framework

## Life is a video game
> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.


## [**Psychology**](./psychology.md)
Forward Propagation
> **Personal Value** is statistical bias from the past. 
> > It's hard to change because it require a lot to dilute denominator.
>
> **Skills** are learned tools. `Procedural Memory`
>
> Problem / [Skill + Value] = [**Choice**](./framework.md#encounter-problem) 
> > Encounter problem, your choice dependence on what skill & value you possess

Backward Propagation
> **Principal** is condense version`common denominator` of **skills**.
>
> **Framework** is collection of **Principals**.
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
> 
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
> 
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](./framework.md)

# Principal
- 4 choice handle problem
> 1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.
> 2. Change path to avoid problem.
> 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
> 4. Get others resolve problem for you.

- Pain + Reflection = Progress
> Mistake indices there is a problem; It's up to player which 1 out of 4 ways to handle it.
>> If you choose #3; You may unlock a game equipment`principle, skill, money, or lesson`; It's up to you to collect`or not collect` this new equipment
>
>> Principle has different level, you can **REFINE** principle to get better principle; Or keep using level 1 principle`early child conclusion` you collected; 

- Everything has its mechanic;
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.

- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.
> Everything cost something.

- Great power comes great responsibility`spider-man`
> IMO: Most people problem is they want power `money, position` without responsibility;
> 
> It's easy envy rich, because you did't pay its responsibility`cost`.

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;


# Recognize Pattern
- Most things have recursive property
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict;
> Solution/Hack around by delay response`aka cool off period`;

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you
> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Top down view VS bottom up view

- Intelligence also equilibrium of supply`often too much focus` and demand`often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue
> The reason for Brand, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.


# Personal Value
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.
- Repetition training is most effective way to change.
- Change your path is easier than change what your desire.

# Common Judgement
- When leader w strong ego, their ability is ceiling of their team.

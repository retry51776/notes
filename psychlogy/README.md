# Workflow
> Inspired by Ray Dalio's Principal; Here is my desire psychology workflow.
> 
> To read more about [**psychology**](./psychology.md)

## **Central Nervous System Workflow**
Forward Propagation Workflow `aka decision process`

> **Attention** > Sensation > **Perception** > **Association** > [**Action**](#action)
>
> > Association find related [**Knowledge**](#knowledge) to problem, Knowledge determents your [**Action**](#action)
>  >1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.
>  >2. Change path to avoid problem.
>  >3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
>  >4. Get others resolve problem for you.
> 
> > Note: Rational Logic is subset of knowledge.


Backward Propagation Workflow `aka reflection process`
> Result > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Implementation

### Knowledge
> Knowledge is byproduct`RNN hidden state` of Workflow;
> 
> Knowledge includes skills, principals, frameworks, and personal value;

> Personal value is statistical bias `aka pattern` from the past action & result.
> > Hard to change personal value because value require many different Results to dilute existing denominator.
>
> > We are always be `bias` because we all only experiences subset of realities.
> 
> **Skills** are learned [**Actions**](#action). `Procedural Memory`
>
> [**Principals**](#principal) are common rule across many skills;
>
> [**Frameworks**](#framework) are collection of principals.
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
> 
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
> 
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](./framework.md)
> 
> > Understanding Framework will change personal value like distribution able calculate median point;


# Principal
- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
- All knowledge build on top assumptions, aware assumption can be invalidated.
- Pain + Reflection = Progress
> Mistake indices there is a problem; It's up to player which 1 out of 4 ways to handle it.
>> If you choose #3; You may unlock a game equipment`principle, skill, money, or lesson`; It's up to you to collect`or not collect` this new equipment
>
>> Principle has different level, you can **REFINE** principle to get better principle; Or keep using level 1 principle`early child conclusion` you collected; 

- Everything has its mechanic;
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.
> Everything cost something.

- Great power comes great responsibility`spider-man`
> IMO: Most people problem is they want power `money, position` without responsibility;
> 
> Parenting should base on equal respect; Make kid understand more choices comes with more responsibility.

# Recognize Pattern
- Most people happy when they have new ability.
> That's why kid way happier than adult, kid unlock new ability more frequents than adult.


- Most things have recursive property
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill


- Correct workflow is more valuable than correct answer.
> Most parent mistakes root from parent value correct behavior OVER child's psychology workflow.


- We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict;
> Solution/Hack around by delay response`aka cool off period`;

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you
> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Top down view VS bottom up view

- Intelligence also equilibrium of supply`often too much focus` and demand`often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue
> The reason for Brand, Company, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.

- When leader w strong ego, their ability is ceiling of their team.

- Establish goal & rule in advanced, and transparent environment.

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;


- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.


- Repetition training is most effective way to change.

- Change your path is easier than change what your desire.


## Framework
> Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.




# Action
> aka: Action > Result > Evaluation > Diagnosis > Design > Implementation
- choice 1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.


- choice 2. Avoid problem.
  - 2.1 Change path without change desires
  - 2.2 Change path & desires


- choice 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
  - 3.1 listen other | observe problem
    - 3.1.1 bad decision `already know what went wrong`
      - missing knowledge;
      - lack of training;
      - improve process design;
    - 3.1.2 missing skill `have an idea of what need to learn`
      - lack of motivation;
      - lack of resource;
    - 3.1.3 psychology problem `root to multiple problems`
      - attention?
      - association?
        - personal bias? `dilute bias`
        - unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`
      - perception? `what you don't noticed? Can you practice to improve perception?`
      - sensation? `i can't fix blind; any work around?`
  - 3.2 validate problem
    - 3.2.1 can you reproduce problem?
    - 3.2.2 can you limited variables?
    - 3.2.3 can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
  - 3.3 communication
    - 3.3.1 If any one using reptilian brain, delay communication
    - 3.3.2 Establish connection by confirm their feeling, share your feeling
  - 3.4 design solution
    - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember compromise
    - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement
  - 3.5 training
    - 3.5.1 confirm improvement
    - 3.5.2 repeatation is the key
  - 3.6 explore alternative
    - 3.6.1 what if?
  - 3.7 conclusion
    - 3.7.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson
    - 3.7.2 Other subject/problem have inspiration from new conclusion
    - 3.7.2 Add conclusion to log
  - 3.8 develop trust
    - 3.8.1 Trust yourself to resolve problem
    - 3.8.2 Other trust you to resolve problem


- choice 4. Get others resolve problem for you.
  - 4.1 Reliance on others
  - 4.2 Observe & go to #3

# Psychology
> Psychology are ways of thinking and behaving.
> > IMO: Psychology is similar to chip design; Workload & resource determent optimal design.
> 
> > I assumed brain assign neuron functionality based on neuron location`more connections more computation?`, sensor location, output location, supply routes, and workflow design? Is brain balance between least neuron and capture reality?
> 
> > Each cortex lob are registers; Association Areas is CPU`more like FPGA`; some cortex also acts as storage;
>
> Is Brain Process asynchronous?

> We observe other's behavior`solution`, copy cat their behavior`like cheating in exam`; Then result will trigger feedback system`by neurotransmitters trigger emotions & memory`;


# Hardware
- Brain Process `Brain function is localized`
  - **Neocortex** `aka Human Brain 4 lobs + Association Area`
    - **Association Areas** `link memory to sensor or processor; key thing we develop in life`
      - correlation
      - learning
      - thinking `reroute info to logic area`
    - **Frontal lob** `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
      - speaking
      - planning
      - judging
      - abstract
    - Parietal lob `nerve input processor;`
    - Occipital lob `vision; its associate logic area to understand concealed information`
      - Top Down View
      - Bottom Up View
    - **Temporal lob** `logic; pattern; memory;`
      - comprehension
      - sound
      - speech

  - **Limbic System** `aka Mammal Brain; IMO logic here, but about children level logic`
    - Pituitary Gland `look /bio/human`
    - Hypothalamus `look /bio/human`
    - Amygdala `memory consolidation & emotion`
      - Emotion
        - Sad
        - Disgust
        - Happy
        - Surprise
        - Anger
        - Fear
      - Episodic Memory `Remember events`
      - Procedural Memory `How to do things; Habits?`
    - Hippocampus `learning and memory; `
      - Semantic Memory `knowledge`

  - Reptilian brain `aka Reptile Brain: basic body functions`
    - Thalamus `Info Router`
    - Cerebellum `Movement Control`
      - Flight
      - Fight
    - Survival System `circulation, breathing, heart, digest`

below head
- Moveability `both Brain & Muscle & Control System`
  - Carry, Move other object
  - Self Moveability
- Digestive system
- Reproductive system


# 1. Attention
> Most often problem is within this layer;

> Attention is a multiplier of sensation

Selective Attention

Way to change attention?
- reduce distraction
- training
- increase the consequences

# 2. Sensation
> Absolute Threshold of sensation `min stimulation needs to register 50% of the time`
>
> It's not absolute changes matter, but relative change.

## Touch
> Touch is VERY important sensation. `proven by Harry Harlowâ€™s Wire Monkey Mother Experiment`
> > First sensation to commutate between others, develop trust?
> 
> > Sex is just extreme form of touch
>
>
> Touch sensation is 4 sensations
- pressure
- warmth
- cold
- pain

## Vision
> Convolutional neural network(CNN)
> 
> 90% info input by vision

- Depth Perception
- Monocular cues `size of what we see`
  - relative size and height
  - linear perspective
  - texture gradient
  - interposition

## Hearing
> It's useful, but not required perception.

**Smell**

**Taste**

**Kinesthesis** `senses body movement and position`

**Vestibular** `monitor head's position and balance`


# 3. Perception
> How we interpret the information that our senses give us.

> Perception is where a lot information is dropped.`aka lead to MISTAKE;`
> > It's very important to find under perform Perception;
> > It's very **hard to noticed** missing Perception;
## Mental senses
> external and internal, mental or spiritual distress, sense of self, including friendship, companionship and power, psychic capacity

> IDK here, seem lack of Scientific consensus

> Our awareness of ourselves and environment

Self Perception Attributes:
- Extravert `Frontal lob`
- Caring `Frontal lob + Parietal lob + Limbic System + `
- Reliable `Frontal lob + Limbic System/Habits`
- Creative `Thalamus| lobs able make info across multiple lobs?`
- Leadership
- Conceptual `Temporal lob + Occipital lob`
- Tough
- Humble
- Determined

Consciousness state:
- Awake
- Drug Alter `Depressant; Stimulants; Hallucinogens`
- Hypnosis `calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have **heightened concentration and focus**, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion.`
- Sleeping `recuperation; growth; mental function;`

## Nociception
> the perception of pain;
> 
> Trigger to reflection

## Radiation
> sense of color, sense of moods associated with color, sense of temperature


## Thermoception
> the sense of heat

## Proprioception
> the perception of body awareness


# 4. Association
> Sleep develop Association Areas; `why we dream`

> Association Learning links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning
> > Close mind people has strong preconception`from memory` that they can't change association;

> Association Areas is where **mistake** happens too, is easier to noticed but **harder to change** compare to **Perception**
> > Mistake/Forget is not a bug, but a feature enable people combine/decouple different ideas.

> unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`

**ways to change association**
1. avoid trigger
   1. increase awareness
   2. avoid
2. dilution
   1. create new memory replaced association
   2. reedit memory
3. Operant conditioning `aka training w positive and negative feedback`
4. reevaluate associated subject
   1. replace subject`or behavior`
   2. break down subject`aka divide & conquer`


## Vision Association
> Often there is something blocked part of view, yet we still able detected blocked item;
> 
> Vision perception associates logic & pattern to interpret;
> > We develop top-down view & bottom-up view from vision.

## Logic Association
> IDK there is single area do all logic. `maybe Temporal lob?`

> My guess is order is flipped; It's Association **first**, then Logic **second**.

## Emotion & Memory Association
> Memory & Emotion are both organized by `Amygdala?`
> 
> Is this a sub step of association? 
>
> 6 Primary Emotions? `Is all memory have 6 tags?`
> 
> mostly write only hardware? So hack around is not forget`delete` what we want, but increase memory & emotion that we want;

> Basic mechanics of short term memory is neuron associate different signal together. Increase voltage to create more neurotransmitters; The receptor will increase surface area to capture more neurotransmitters;

> Long term memory is neuron develop new terminal directly connects to other neuron; serotonin cause neuron grew new terminal;

# Conclusion
> We must be aware which brain level we operating on;
> > Logic only works in higher level.
>
> > When we talk to a person, imagine talking to 2 people, the logical one and the emotional one `connection before correction`
>
> Try to resolve problem in wrong level is similar fixing bug in different area.
> > Missing Perception? or Bad Association?

> I think we should use Parenting model to train Limbic & reptilian brain

> Memory & Emotion are the same thing
> > If you want to memorize something, tie them to a feeling
> 
> Out of 6 Primary Emotions: 4 consider negative, while 2 maybe positive;
> > Are we suppose to be unhappy more?


> What determent a person's value is their problem; not their ability;

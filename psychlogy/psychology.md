# Psychology
> Psychology are ways of thinking and behaving.
> > IMO: Psychology is similar to chip design; Workload & resource determent optimal design.
> 
> > I assumed brain assign neuron functionality based on neuron location`more connections more computation?`, sensor location, output location, supply routes, and workflow design? Is brain balance between least neuron and capture reality?
> > 
> > I assume brain also use near memory computation design, there fore memory & functions are localized.
> 
> > Each cortex lob are registers; Association Areas is CPU`more like FPGA`; some cortex also acts as storage;

> First: we observe other's behavior`action`, copy cat their behavior`like cheating in exam`;
> 
> Second: result will trigger our feedback system`by neurotransmitters trigger emotions & memory`, then we observe patter & adjust our behavior;


# Questions:
- What/How is Brain Process overall architecture?

- What is ego/pride? something relates to connection? NN input weight?

- How Hippocampus works? Maybe is help AI development.

- 6 Primary Emotions? `Is all memory have 6 tags?`

- Out of 6 Primary Emotions: 4 consider negative, while 2 maybe positive; Are we suppose to be unhappy more?

# Brain
`Brain function is localized`
- **Neocortex** `aka Human Brain; 4 lobs + Association Area + Insular cortex; cortex often 6 layers`
  - **Association Areas** `link memory to sensor or processor; key thing we develop in life`
    - correlation
    - learning
    - thinking `reroute info to logic area`
  - **Frontal lob** `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
    - speaking
    - planning
    - judging
    - abstract
    - smell sensation
  - Parietal lob
    - touch sensation `nerve input processor;`
  - Occipital lob
    - vision sensation`vision; its associate logic area to understand concealed information`
  - **Temporal lob** `logic; pattern; memory;`
    - sound sensation
    - speech
    - comprehension
  - Insular cortex
    - taste sensation

- **Limbic System** `aka Mammal Brain; IMO logic here, but about children level logic; Create Long Term Memory;`
  - [Pituitary Gland](../biology/anatomy.md#endocrine-system)
  - Hypothalamus `regulate basic needs through hormones: sleep, sex, eat, rest;`
  - Amygdala `flight or fight`
  - Thalamus `relay station`
  - Hippocampus `convert short term memory into long term memory; Only create memory;`

- Reptilian brain `aka Reptile Brain: basic body functions`
  - Midbrain `quick sensation process trigger body's reflexes`
  - Pons `regulation of sleep and wakefulness`
  - Medulla `control the muscles of the head and neck`
  - Cerebellum `Movement Control`
  - Brain Stem `breathing, heart, blood pressure, wakefulness;`


# 1. Attention
> Most often problem is within this layer;

> Attention is a multiplier of sensation

> [Personal Value](README.md#personal-value) is a important variable in Attention.

Selective Attention

Way to change attention?
- Reprioritize Personal Values
- reduce distraction
  - avoid trigger
  - change path/environment
- **increase the consequences**
  - increase reward
  - increase/create punishment
- training

# 2. Sensation
> Sensations are the raw data that our brains receive from the outside world.
> 
> Absolute Threshold of sensation `min stimulation needs to register 50% of the time`
>
> It's not absolute changes matter, but relative change.

## Touch
> Touch is VERY important sensation. `proven by Harry Harlowâ€™s Wire Monkey Mother Experiment`
> > First sensation to commutate between others, develop trust?
> 
> > Sex is just extreme form of touch

Touch sensations:
- pressure
- warmth
- cold
- pain

## Vision
> Convolutional neural network(CNN)
> 
> 90% info input by vision

- Depth Perception
- Monocular cues `size of what we see`
  - relative size and height
  - linear perspective
  - texture gradient
  - interposition

## Hearing
> It's useful, but not required perception.

**Smell**
> Directly to brain, only sense that by pass Thalamus.

**Taste**
> Processed by the gustatory system.

**Kinesthesis** `senses body movement and position`

**Vestibular** `monitor head's position and balance`


# 3. Perception
> Perception is brain interpret the information from our senses.
> > Perception can break into 2 major categories: [Biology Perception](#biology-perception) & [Psychology Perception](#psychology-perception);
>
> > Perception is where a lot information is dropped.`aka lead to MISTAKE;`
> 
> > It's very important to find under perform Perception;
> 
> > It's very **hard to noticed** missing Perception;


## Psychology Perception
> Ability to read emotions through body expression. `aka Social awareness Processed by frontal lob?`
> > Psychology Perception on self, or on other?

> Ability includes [desire, knowledge, self awareness, social awareness] determent these personal values:
- Extravert `+social awareness`
- Caring `+social awareness -> self awareness`
- Reliable `+knowledge -> action, +social awareness`
- Creative `+knowledge, - social awareness`
- Leadership `+[desire, knowledge, self awareness, social awareness,]`
- Conceptual `+knowledge`
- Tough `+desire, -self awareness`
- Humble `-desire, +self awareness`
- Determined `+desire, +knowledge`

## Biology Perception
> Biology Perception processed by reptilian brain;
### Nociception
> the perception of pain;
> 
> Trigger to reflection

### Radiation
> sense of color, sense of moods associated with color, sense of temperature

### Thermoception
> the sense of heat

### Proprioception
> the perception of body awareness


# 4. Association
> Association find relevant [**Knowledge**](README.md#knowledge) of problem, Knowledge determents your [**Action**](README.md#action)

> Sleep develop Association Areas; `why we dream`
> > Older people sleep less. Maybe it relates to learning. Sleep is like committing changes in the brain. `aka Less associate adjustment`

> Association Learning links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning
> > Close mind people has strong preconception`from memory` that they can't change association;

> Association Areas is where **mistake** happens too, is easier to noticed but **harder to change** compare to **Perception**
> > Mistake/Forget is not a bug, but a feature enable people combine/decouple different ideas.

> unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`

**ways to change association**
1. avoid trigger
   1. increase awareness
   2. avoid
2. dilution
   1. create new memory replaced association
   2. reedit memory
3. Operant conditioning `aka training w positive and negative feedback`
4. reevaluate associated subject
   1. replace subject`or behavior`
   2. break down subject`aka divide & conquer`


## Vision Association
> Often there is something blocked part of view, yet we still able detected blocked item;
> 
> Vision perception associates logic & pattern to interpret;
> > We develop top-down view & bottom-up view from vision.

## Logic Association
> IDK there is single area do all logic. `maybe Temporal lob?`

> My guess is order is flipped; It's Association **first**, then Logic **second**.

## Emotion & Memory Association
> Memory & Emotion are related
> > All mammal have similar emotions.
> 
> > If you want to memorize something, tie them to a feeling

### Memory encoding
- rehearsal `aka repeat`
- chunking `aka organized memory`
- mnemonic devices
  - image `aka picturize memory`
  - pegword `aka use story`
  - location
  - Acronym
- Self-Referencing
- Spacing `aka repeat study in large time gape`

### Working memory
- Capacity: 7 items +-2
- Duration: 20-30s
- Encoding: Visual and auditory last longer than verbal or written information
  - The positional effect
- Interference: Memory will interfered w each other
- Transfer to long-term memory by Hippocampus
> Basic mechanics of short term memory is neuron associate different signal together. Increase voltage to create more neurotransmitters; The receptor will increase surface area to capture more neurotransmitters;

### Long Term Memory
- Semantic Memory `knowledge`
- Episodic Memory `Remember events by sensation`
- Procedural Memory `How to do things`
> Long Term Memory & Emotion are created by Hippocampus, and store in different areas in cortex;
> 
> Long term memory is neuron develop new terminal directly connects to other neuron; serotonin cause neuron grew new terminal;

### Primary Emotions
- Sad
- Disgust
- Happy
- Surprise
- Anger
- Fear


# Conclusion
> We must be aware which brain level we operating on;
> > Logic only works in higher level.
>
> > When we talk to a person, imagine talking to 2 people, the logical one and the emotional one `connection before correction`
>
> Try to resolve problem in wrong level is similar fixing bug in different area.
> > Missing Perception? or Bad Association?

> I think we should use Parenting model to train Limbic & reptilian brain

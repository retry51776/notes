Game Rules:
Assume the world starts with x numbers of players, each w some assets; (assets can be unique skillset or products, some are transferable, and some are bound to the player)
The game will evaluate at some integral; Once satisfied with critical assets and time, the game will produce new assets, With complex assets requirement increase. The player can change an asset allocation; 

Strategy - This game is very similar to the sorting problem
Direct swap asset is most straightforward but very limited;
Advance assets have complex requirements, such as a specific player's skillet, a large number of asset requirements, long time;

The current solution is we create some placeholder that enables assets to decouple from the owner/producer;
The current solution focus on matching correct asset allocation; 
New assets distribute to the credit's owner, not the producer;


Notes:
Any two trust parties can create Credit/Placeholders.
Credit/Placeholders are backed by existing assets or promises of future assets.
Not all Credit/Placeholders are equal;

FAQ:
How do I create credit? When you promise to do homework, get your parents to buy ice cream. You get ice cream without doing homework yet; Just a promise.
How do I create credit that everyone uses? When you get a mortgage/loan from the bank.
How do I create real money without liability? 
A: Federal Reserve creates credit in their computer network with a keyboard. It doesn't cause them anything but the electricity they pay with credit!
B: Commerical Banks that approve your loan. The credit/money they loan you MOSTLY doesn't exist, just like the Federal Reserve, where most are digits in their computer. Commercial Bank does constrain by [reserve liquidity, bad loans, initial capital]
C: The company takes a loan from Bank or creates a junk bond, then default!
D: Same as C, but use your personal credit.

Criticism:
With more Actors & Assets, the game requires more & more placeholders, which also causes the farther decoupled producer to the owner.
Banks are no longer at risk of loans, yet Banks can still create credit! US banks started offload risk; EX: Mortage Backed Security(MBS) is a bundle of mortages, then sold to investors in a lower rate & bank profit by rate difference.
Banks these days profit from nothing by creating different derivatives. Banks should either hold loan risk & allow fraction reserve, or act as Investment Banks to offload risk.
Bank no longer act as credit shared places for people. Most of their credits come from Federal Reserve. People's ability to get a loan is limited to mortgages and credit cards. Think of QA having a bias to review senior dev PRs, not junior dev PRs.
We, the people, produce new assets. Yet new credit is created by banks. Some assets are distributed to the producer, but most of the new assets' ownership goes to the bank. Unless we can allocate all required assets without a bank network, newly created wealth by default, goes to bank.

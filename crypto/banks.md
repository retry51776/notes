# Forces
> We have both supply & demand; In a perfect world we would be self sufficient; Our supply perfectly match with our demand;
- Demand
  - Credit `aka desire requires borrow against future; similar to peak load in electricity grid`
    - Treasury bonds
      - Yield Rate `Exchange rate of government future promise to dollar, determent by Federal Reserve & open market`
      - Yield maturity
    - Municipal bonds
    - Corporate bonds
    - Asset-backed securities (ABS)
      - Mortgage
      - Other Loan
    - Consumer Credit
  - Natural Needs `aka basic desire; similar to base load in electricity grid;`
    - Physical
      - Food
      - Garment
      - Shelter
      - Movability
    - Psychology `ask marketing team`
      - Trust `fear will increase demand`
      - Ego
      - self actualization
- Supply
  - Assets `aka hardware; similar to electricity that stored in battery;`
    - Resources
      - Commodities
      - Land `Ex: flatten space, access harbor, high ground for dam`
      - Labor `matter less & less`
    - Logistic Hardware `includes road, train, airplane, ship`
  - Technology `aka software; similar engineer for electricity grid`
    - Technology `aka material science, nuclear`
    - Entrepreneurship `aka companies; existing electricity factory`
      - Logistic Software `Ex: ERP, Uber, UPS, Internet ...`
      - Capital `only accelerate on short term deployment; Ex: Uber`


- Accidents
  - Man make Disasters
    - Political disasters
      - War
      - Terrorist attacks
      - Cyber attacks
    - Industrial accidents
      - Nuclear accidents
      - Oil spills
      - Environmental degradation
  - Natural Disasters
    - Asteroid
    - Pandemic
    - Earth Quack
    - Weather

> Demand factor:
> Credit, Natural Need `aka population`, Accidents 

> Supply Network:
> Resources > Logistic > Technology > Logistic > Product

> Federal Reserve similar software manage electricity grid; By adjusting Interest Rate `Interest Rate is exchange rate current assets to future promise` to flatten Demand Peak; Supply advancement requires more assets `rare to come by`, or technology advancement `not in Fed control`;

> Credit is simultaneously be created & destoried by everyone at every day. When anyone(individual, company, government) take out loan, we created credit. Every payment we paid out loan, we destoried credit. There will always more debet than credit(because interest).

## Bond
- Maturity
- Coupon
- Yield
- Price
- Face Value

- Callability
- Inflation protection
- Liquidity

# Analogy
> Here are the rules for the game:
>
> At the start of the game, there are x players, each with some assets (which may include unique skills or products, some of which are transferable and some of which are bound to the player).
>
> The game will be evaluated at certain intervals. When the game determines that a player has acquired enough critical assets and has spent enough time playing, it will produce new assets.
>
> Advanced assets have complex requirements, such as requiring a specific player's skillset, a large number of other assets, and a long time investment.
>
> Players can change their allocation of assets or form teams in order to meet the requirements for advanced assets.

> The strategy for this game is similar to solving a sorting problem.
> 
> The most straightforward approach is to directly swap assets, but this method has limited utility. Our current solution focuses on finding the correct asset allocation. We use placeholder assets to allow assets to be separated from their owner or producer. When new assets are produced, they are distributed to the owner of the credits, rather than the producer.


## Notes:
> Not all Credit/Placeholders are equal;

> Any two trust parties can create Placeholders `Credit`.

> Placeholders `Credit` are promises of future assets.


## FAQ:
- How do I create credit? When you promise to do homework, get your parents to buy ice cream. You get ice cream without doing homework yet; Just a promise.
- How do I create credit that everyone uses? When you get a mortgage/loan from the bank.
- How do I create real money without liability? 
  - A: Federal Reserve creates credit in their computer network with a keyboard. It doesn't cause them anything but the electricity they pay with credit!
  - B: Commercial Banks that approve your loan. The credit/money they loan you MOSTLY doesn't exist, just like the Federal Reserve, where most are digits in their computer. Commercial Bank does constrain by [reserve liquidity, bad loans, initial capital]
  - C: ~~The company takes a loan from Bank or creates a junk bond, then default!~~
  - D: ~~Same as C, but use your personal credit.~~
- Why would asset owner trade their asset for credit when credit will devalue?
  - A: All assets decays, some decay faster; Ex: food decays within a week, while gold hardly decays; Which explain why people value gold more than food, even when people can't live without food;
  - B: Specialized caused producers over produce for their own uses! Farmer won't consume all their crops, same as car worker can't consume all cars they made; Also make producer dependence on other producers;
- What is cash in this framework? Paper money/Greenback is legacy from previous system. When we switch over current system @ 1935, new system for backward compatibility will always exchange 1 to 1 bank credit to cash. The world is run by credit, not cash(which only printed by government). In fact cash use case is getting smaller & smaller;
- How is Government create credit? Same as you, get a loan from the banks! The only difference is banker will always buy government bond. Market determent T-Bond price. Because everyone trust government's T-Bond(promise), there is T-Bond market, which is key indicator/baseline of every other markets(Ex: stock, MBS, Corp Bond, ...)

# Criticism:
- With more Actors & Assets, the game requires more & more placeholders, which also causes the farther decoupled producer to the owner.
- Banks are no longer holding risk of loans, yet Banks can still create credit! US banks started offload risk; EX: Mortgage Backed Security(MBS) is a bundle of mortgages, then sold to investors in a lower rate & bank profit by rate difference.
- Banks these days profit from nothing by creating different derivatives. Banks should either hold loan risk & allow fraction reserve, or act as Investment Banks to risk distributor.
- Bank no longer act as credit shared places for people. Most of their credits come from Federal Reserve. People's ability to get a loan is limited to mortgages and credit cards. Think of QA having a bias to review senior dev PRs, not junior dev PRs.
- We, the people, produce new assets. Yet new credit is created by banks. Some assets are distributed to the producer, but most of the new assets' ownership goes to the bank. Unless we can allocate all required assets without a bank network, newly created wealth by default, goes to bank.

## Shortcut Thought
1 - interest_rate = exchange_rate of future_asset to current_asset

> If Fed set too high interest rate, people will arbitrage different by sell current assets for future promise; (aka Paul Volcker caused recession in 1980 to stop inflation)

> If Fed set too low interest rate, people will arbitrage different by make future promise for current assets; (aka 2020 all assets price increase)

> In 2020, everyone know interest rate is lower than reality. There for every rush to create credit to buy current assets;
> In 2022, Fed want to reduce inflation. My prediction is inflation will still way higher.
> Reason is a lot credit created in 2020-2021 most likely are bad promises.
> Rate hike over reality won't punish those created bad promises
> 
> Over hike rates just hurt producer that currently trying to produce. Anytime Fed is set wrong rate, smart trader profit by arbitrage. 

> Also because deglobalization / trust broken. Seem like players will sub divided into smaller groups, which trade efficiency for redundancy. My only concern that some unique resource(space?) cause two sub group fight.

# Loan Effect Example
In the village with total $100 credit, and credit is use to distribute fish; There are 10 fisherman, and you are 1 of them;

You catch a fish per day, sold $10/fish; 10% village resource allocation right!

Today you talk to banker: I'll get a team to catch 5 fish, please loan me $20 to hire another fisherman

Banker trust you & created $20 note & give it to you;

Case 1: Your team did catch 5 fish, contribution = 5 / (5 + 8) = 38.46%; Village now has $120 credit, $120 * 38.46% = $46.152;
Then -$20 bank, $11 to fisherman, $10 for self labor = $5.12 extra income; Other fisherman contribution = 1 / (5 + 8) = 7.69%; $120 * 7.69% = $9.23; even know each fisherman get $9.23, they still able to buy a fish because there is 13 fish; Now bank has $20, which is 16.6% contribution power allow bank buy 2.166 fish;


Case 2: You team did NOT catch anything; Of course you will be bankrupt, and no one trust you again; You have $20 - $11 = $9 leftover money, but bank took away; Village now has $111 credit, $100 + $11(your teammate salary); Fisherman didn't catch any fish still has $11, which is $11/$111 = 9.9% contribution, which dilute other fisherman contribution;
> Other fisherman doesn't know credit increased, only sold $10 per fish; Which at this point, fisherman who catch a fish, sold it for $10, can't buy back the fish for $10! fish price = $111 / 8 = $13.875;
> Other fisherman realized credit increased, $111 / 8 = $13.875, but everyone in village expected buy $10 fish won't able to, because we caught less fish, and Fisherman didn't catch any fish still has $11

Banker has $11 lost on their book; Either next loan able to recover lost, or lost accumulate, eventually cause recession.
## Example Conclusion
> Increase productivity has risk, when successful increase productivity banker take a cut(can be big or small, dependence on number); When failed attempted, cost of failure either distribute in whole society, or accumulate in bank system.

- Expectation/Credit `self reflection & distribution`

> Think of state as a man; Just like any people, of course he want everything; Credit is his good job sticker(sometime is easier to get, sometime is harder); his future strength is always unknown variable; The goal is good job sticker should roughly have consistence value(if sudden sticker is easier to earn, then he may sudden work harder, in the cost of future he won't);

> Gov is like part of brain decides goal, wishes of society.
> Fed Reserve is like heart(credit circular speed) & bone(credit produce) does control blood in body;
> Finance Industry is part of brain does planning for society. Leverage is a must in order to amplify signal;
> Company is like organ, organize cells to do some function;
> People is like cell that does some work;

> mixing flower to make dope, fed add water(credit) to mix, gov shake water & flower, people adds flower

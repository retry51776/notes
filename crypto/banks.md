# Forces
> We have both supply and demand. In a perfect world we would be self‑sufficient; our supply would perfectly match our demand.

## Demand
- **Credit** (desire to borrow against the future; similar to peak load in an electricity grid)
  - Treasury bonds
    - Yield rate – exchange rate of government’s future promise to dollars, determined by the Federal Reserve & open market.
    - Yield maturity
  - Municipal bonds
  - Corporate bonds
  - Asset‑backed securities (ABS)
    - Mortgage
    - Other loans
  - Consumer credit
- **Natural needs** (basic desires; similar to base load in an electricity grid)
  - Physical
    - Food
    - Garments
    - Shelter
    - Mobility
  - Psychological *(marketing perspective)*
    - Trust – fear increases demand
    - Ego
    - Self‑actualisation

## Supply
- **Assets** (hardware; analogous to stored energy in a battery)
  - Resources
    - Commodities
    - Land *(e.g., flatten space, access harbours, high ground for dams)*
    - Labor – becoming less scarce
  - Logistic hardware *(roads, rail, aircraft, ships)*
- **Technology** (software; analogous to engineers for an electricity grid)
  - Material science, nuclear tech, etc.
  - Entrepreneurship *(companies; existing electricity factories)*
    - Logistic software *(ERP, Uber, UPS, Internet …)*
    - Capital – accelerates short‑term deployment (e.g., Uber)

## Accidents
- **Man‑made disasters**
  - Political: war, terrorism, cyber attacks
  - Industrial: nuclear accidents, oil spills, environmental degradation
- **Natural disasters**
  - Asteroid impact
  - Pandemic
  - Earthquake
  - Severe weather

> Demand factors: credit, natural need (population), accidents.  
> Supply network: resources → logistics → technology → logistics → product.

## Analogy to the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve is like software that manages an electricity grid. By adjusting interest rates *(the exchange rate between current assets and future promises)* it flattens demand peaks. Supply advancement requires more assets (rare) or technological progress (outside Fed control).

Credit is created and destroyed daily by everyone:
- Taking a loan creates credit.
- Repaying a loan destroys credit.

There will always be more debt than credit because of interest.

## Bond Basics
- Maturity
- Coupon
- Yield
- Price
- Face value
- Credit rating
- Callability
- Inflation protection
- Liquidity

# FAQ
- **How do I create credit?**  
  Promise to do homework; get your parents to buy ice‑cream. You receive ice‑cream without having done the work yet – a promise.
- **How do I create credit that everyone uses?**  
  Obtain a mortgage or loan from a bank.
- **How do I create money without liability?**  
  - A: The Federal Reserve creates credit in its computers with a keyboard; it only costs electricity.  
  - B: Commercial banks approve loans; most of the resulting money exists as digits, similar to the Fed’s system, constrained by reserve liquidity, bad loans, and capital.  
  - C: *(removed outdated examples)*

- **Why would an asset owner trade their asset for credit that may devalue?**  
  - All assets decay; some faster than others (e.g., food vs. gold).  
  - Producers often over‑produce for themselves, creating excess supply that must be exchanged.

- **What is cash in this framework?**  
  Paper money/greenbacks are legacy. When we switched in 1935, a 1:1 exchange between bank credit and cash was established. Today the world runs on credit; cash is shrinking.

- **How does the government create credit?**  
  By taking loans from banks. The difference is that governments issue Treasury bonds, which become a benchmark for all other markets (stocks, MBS, corporate bonds, …).

## Criticism
- More actors and assets increase the need for placeholders, further decoupling producers from owners.
- Banks no longer hold loan risk; they create credit via derivatives.  
  *Banks should either retain loan risk and maintain fractional reserves or act purely as investment banks distributing risk.*

- Modern banks profit from creating complex derivatives rather than providing credit to individuals.

## Shortcut Thought
1. `interest_rate = exchange_rate(future_asset, current_asset)`

> If the Fed sets rates too high, people arbitrage by selling current assets for future promises (e.g., Paul Volcker’s 1980 recession).  
> If rates are too low, people borrow to buy current assets (e.g., 2020 boom).

During 2020‑2021 massive credit creation led to many bad promises; rate hikes later may not punish those bad loans. Over‑hiking hurts productive firms, while under‑hiking fuels speculative arbitrage.

## Loan Effect Example
*Village with total $100 credit and 10 fishermen (each catches one fish per day, sold for $10).*

- **Case 1:** You borrow $20 to hire another fisherman, catching 5 fish.  
  - Village credit rises to $120. Your contribution: 5 / (5 + 8) = 38.46 % → $46.15 value. After paying the bank and salary, you earn an extra $5.12. Other fishermen’s share drops proportionally.

- **Case 2:** You borrow $20 but catch nothing.  
  - Village credit becomes $111 (due to salaries). Your leftover $9 is lost to the bank. Remaining fishermen now face higher fish prices ($13.88) and reduced purchasing power.

The bank either recovers losses later or contributes to a recession.

## Three Key Forces
### Demand / Desires
- Age, external environment, capability projection, individual desires, credit market.

### Supply / Capability
- Resources → logistics → technology → logistics → product.

### Expectation / Credit
- Self‑reflection and distribution mechanisms.

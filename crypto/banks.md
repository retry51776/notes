## Game Rules:
> Assume the world starts with x numbers of players, each w some assets; (assets can be unique skillset or products, some are transferable, and some are bound to the player)

> The game will evaluate at some integral; Once satisfied with critical assets and time, the game will produce new assets.

> Advance assets have complex requirements, such as a specific player's skillet, a large number of asset requirements, long time;

> The player can change an asset allocation, or team up together to satisfied requirements.

## Strategy - This game is very similar to the sorting problem
> Direct swap asset is most straightforward but very limited;

> The current solution focus on matching correct asset allocation; 

> We create some placeholder that enables assets to decouple from the owner/producer;

> New assets distribute to the credit's owner, not the producer;


## Notes:
> Not all Credit/Placeholders are equal;

> Any two trust parties can create Credit/Placeholders.

> Credit/Placeholders are promises of future assets.


## FAQ:
- How do I create credit? When you promise to do homework, get your parents to buy ice cream. You get ice cream without doing homework yet; Just a promise.
- How do I create credit that everyone uses? When you get a mortgage/loan from the bank.
- How do I create real money without liability? 
- - A: Federal Reserve creates credit in their computer network with a keyboard. It doesn't cause them anything but the electricity they pay with credit!
- - B: Commercial Banks that approve your loan. The credit/money they loan you MOSTLY doesn't exist, just like the Federal Reserve, where most are digits in their computer. Commercial Bank does constrain by [reserve liquidity, bad loans, initial capital]
- - C: ~~The company takes a loan from Bank or creates a junk bond, then default!~~
- - D: ~~Same as C, but use your personal credit.~~
- Why would asset owner trade their asset for credit when credit will devalue?
- - A: All assets decays, some decay faster; Ex: food decays within a week, while gold hardly decays; Which explain why people value gold more than food, even when people can't live without food;
- - B: Specialized caused producers over produce for their own uses! Farmer won't consume all their crops, same as car worker can't consume all cars they made; Also make producer dependence on other producers;
- What is cash in this framework? Paper money/Greenback is legacy from previous system. When we switch over current system @ 1935, new system for backward compatibility will always exchange 1 to 1 bank credit to cash. The world is run by credit, not cash(which only printed by government). In fact cash use case is getting smaller & smaller;
- How is Government create credit? Same as you, get a loan from the banks! The only difference is banker will always buy government bond. Market determent T-Bond price. Because everyone trust government's T-Bond(promise), there is T-Bond market, which is key indicator/baseline of every other markets(Ex: stock, MBS, Corp Bond, ...)

# Criticism:
- With more Actors & Assets, the game requires more & more placeholders, which also causes the farther decoupled producer to the owner.
- Banks are no longer at risk of loans, yet Banks can still create credit! US banks started offload risk; EX: Mortgage Backed Security(MBS) is a bundle of mortgages, then sold to investors in a lower rate & bank profit by rate difference.
- Banks these days profit from nothing by creating different derivatives. Banks should either hold loan risk & allow fraction reserve, or act as Investment Banks to risk distributor.
- Bank no longer act as credit shared places for people. Most of their credits come from Federal Reserve. People's ability to get a loan is limited to mortgages and credit cards. Think of QA having a bias to review senior dev PRs, not junior dev PRs.
- We, the people, produce new assets. Yet new credit is created by banks. Some assets are distributed to the producer, but most of the new assets' ownership goes to the bank. Unless we can allocate all required assets without a bank network, newly created wealth by default, goes to bank.

## Shortcut Thought
1 - interest_rate = exchange_rate of future_asset to current_asset

> If Fed set too high interest rate, people will arbitrage different by sell current assets for future promise; (aka Paul Volcker caused recession in 1980 to stop inflation)

> If Fed set too low interest rate, people will arbitrage different by make future promise for current assets; (aka 2020 all assets price increase)

> In 2020, everyone know interest rate is lower than reality. There for every rush to create credit to buy current assets;
> In 2022, Fed want to reduce inflation. My prediction is inflation will still way higher.
> Reason is a lot credit created in 2020-2021 most likely are bad promises.
> Rate hike over reality won't punish those created bad promises
> 
> Over hike rates just hurt producer that currently trying to produce. Anytime Fed is set wrong rate, smart trader profit by arbitrage. 

> Also because deglobalization / trust broken. Seem like players will sub divided into smaller groups, which trade efficiency for redundancy. My only concern that some unique resource(space?) cause two sub group fight.

# Loan Effect Example
In the village with total $100 credit, and credit is use to distribute fish; There are 10 fisherman, and you are 1 of them;

You catch a fish per day, sold $10/fish; 10% village resource allocation right!

Today you talk to banker: I'll get a team to catch 5 fish, please loan me $20 to hire another fisherman

Banker trust you & created $20 note & give it to you;

Case 1: Your team did catch 5 fish, contribution = 5 / (5 + 8) = 38.46%; Village now has $120 credit, $120 * 38.46% = $46.152;
Then -$20 bank, $11 to fisherman, $10 for self labor = $5.12 extra income; Other fisherman contribution = 1 / (5 + 8) = 7.69%; $120 * 7.69% = $9.23; even know each fisherman get $9.23, they still able to buy a fish because there is 13 fish; Now bank has $20, which is 16.6% contribution power allow bank buy 2.166 fish;


Case 2: You team did NOT catch anything; Of course you will be bankrupt, and no one trust you again; You have $20 - $11 = $9 leftover money, but bank took away; Village now has $111 credit, $100 + $11(your teammate salary); Fisherman didn't catch any fish still has $11, which is $11/$111 = 9.9% contribution, which dilute other fisherman contribution;
> Other fisherman doesn't know credit increased, only sold $10 per fish; Which at this point, fisherman who catch a fish, sold it for $10, can't buy back the fish for $10! fish price = $111 / 8 = $13.875;
> Other fisherman realized credit increased, $111 / 8 = $13.875, but everyone in village expected buy $10 fish won't able to, because we caught less fish, and Fisherman didn't catch any fish still has $11

Banker has $11 lost on their book; Either next loan able to recover lost, or lost accumulate, eventually cause recession.
## Example Conclusion
> Increase productivity has risk, when successful increase productivity banker take a cut(can be big or small, dependence on number); When failed attempted, cost of failure either distribute in whole society, or accumulate in bank system.

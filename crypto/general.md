# Crypto

Think of computation as cooking food.

- data → food  
- Software As Service (SaaS) → take‑out restaurant with a closed kitchen  

> You don't know how, who, or cooks the food; you just trust the brand.

In‑house server → home cook  

> Messy, and do you have a clean/updated kitchen?

Cloud vendor → commercial landlord  

> Provided by the landlord; they can take it away or have a backdoor. Usually clean & well equipped.

Blockchain → open kitchen  

> Anyone can be cooking in the kitchen (miner), but all dishes (blocks) need public review before being shipped (node verification).

**Homomorphic encryption**  
Plastic wrap/glove for food/data; allows processing data without touching it.

**zk‑SNARK**  
Food container/packaging technology; able to package food and prove its cleanliness just by the package.

- Merkle tree
- Block header
- Consensus
  - Proof of work
  - Proof of stake
- Transaction ledger vs. balance ledger
- Scalability trilemma: security, decentralisation, scalability

> Cryptoeconomics uses economic incentives to provide guarantees about applications.

## Private Communication
- Asymmetric encryption
- Proxy re‑encryption
- Access control

## Solana
- Separate transaction throughput from consensus?
- I don't get it; the white paper is poor.

**Compound**  
Launched February 2019. Interest rates are calculated every block; there are no fixed rates.

## Fiat System
> The fiat system is similar to an IP system we have. For network admins, this will make sense!

> Imagine a world where we live in a company and trade with IP addresses.

- Federal Reserve (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
- 12 Federal Reserve Banks (Internet Service Providers)
- Commercial banks (companies)
- `public_ip` (cash or federal_reserve_credit)
- `private_ip` (bank_credit)

When you trade with someone in the same bank (company), the bank creates a `private_ip` (bank credit) for the transaction.

Only when you trade with someone outside your bank (other banks) does your bank give a `public_ip` (cash or federal_reserve_credit) to the other bank.

Most people assume `private_ip` (bank credit) = `public_ip` (cash or federal_reserve_credit), which is **not** true. In fact, ordinary people do **not** have access to federal reserve credit.

People also don’t realise the different types of credits:
- Cash — printed by the US government.
- Federal‑reserve credit — digits in the Federal Reserve’s computer.
- Bank credit — digits in a commercial bank’s computer.

Most people make this wrong assumption because banks can usually convert `private_ip` (bank credit) to `public_ip` (cash).

When banks create too many private IPs (bank credits) without enough public IPs (cash), the risk of failed conversions (failed cash withdrawals) rises. Fear spreads, triggering a bank run and causing more failures.

## My Thoughts
> Should we abandon this multi‑layer tree structure— which inherently allows some groups to create credit (stealing purchasing power from those who can’t)—and replace it with a flatter system where credit goes to the ledger maintainer under preset rules, hoping it eventually reaches equilibrium?

> IMO, BTC distribution is messy; over time it will improve. Bitcoin’s incentive model encourages cooperation. Accurate accounting is a problem in the current system, and Bitcoin handles it well. We don’t need a perfect system, just a better one.

> My hope is for a peer‑to‑peer crypto network that the whole world trusts (don’t trust, verify!), providing fair opportunities to everyone. This would encourage contributions to automation, research, and equitable distribution.

> BTC was born from libertarian ideals. It was never about getting rich fast. I really hope BTC continues its original goal.

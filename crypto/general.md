# Crypto

Think of computation is cooking food.

data -> food
ssas -> take out resturant with closed kitchen

> You don't know how, who, cook the food; You just trust brand


inhouse server -> home cook

> messy, and do you have clean/updated kitchen?


cloud vendor -> comercial landlord

> provide by landloard, they can take it away, or have a backdoor; usually cleam & well equipped

blockchain -> open kitchen

> Anyone can be kitchen cooking(miner), but all dishes(block) needs public review before shipped(node verfication)


homorphic encryption
> plastic wrap/glove for food/data; Able process data without touch data;

zk-snark
> food container/ packaging technology; able to package food, and able to proven cleanness just by package.


- merkle tree
- block header
- consensus
  - proof of work
  - proof of stake
- transaction ledger vs balance ledger
- scability trilemma: security, decentralized, scalable

## Private Communication
- Asy encryption
- Proxy Re-encryption
- Access Control


## Solana
- separate transaction throughput from consensus?
- I don't get it, white paper sucks

**Compound**
2019-Feb launch
Interest Rate is calculate every block, no fix rates

## Fiat System
> Fiat System is similar to IP system we have. For network admin, this will make sense!

> Image a world where we lives at Company, trade with IP address

- Federal Reserve (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
- 12 Federal Reserve Banks (Internet Service Providers)
- Commercial Banks (Company)
- public_ip (cash or federal_reserve_credit)
- private_ip (bank_credit)
- transaction (transfer ip ownership)

When you trade w someone in same bank(Company), bank(Company) will creates private_ip(bank_credit) for the transaction(transfer ip ownership).

Only when you trade w someone outside bank(Other banks), then bank(Your Bank) will give public_ip (cash or federal_reserve_credit) to outside bank(Other banks).

Most people assumed private_ip(bank_credit) = public_ip(cash or federal_reserve_credit), which is NOT true. In fact normal people do NOT have access federal_reserve_credit.

Most people also doesn't realized different credits
- cash `printed by US gov.`
- federal_reserve_credit `digits in federal_reserver computer`
- bank_credit `digit in commercial bank's computer`

Most people made these wrong assumetion because most the time Banks(Company) able to convert private_ip(bank_credit) to public_ip(cash)

When Banks(Company) creates too many private_ip (bank_credit) without public_ip (cash or federal_reserve_credit), this will increase changes of failed conversation(failed cash withdraw); Then as fear spread, this trigger bank run(cause more failures)

## My Thoughts
> Should we abbandon this multi-layer trees structure `inherently allow some groups create credit(steal purchas power from those can't), and a smaller group w major levedge of whole system`, replace with some kind flat layer system `credit goes to ledger maintainer w preset rules, hope eventually go to equilibrium`?

> IMO, BTC distribution is very mess up, in defense BTC distribution will get better as time goes. I think credit system is meant to encourage ppl work together. Accurate accounting is definility problem in current system, and BTC is very good at it. We don't need a prefect system, just a better one.

> My hope is some peer to peer cryto network the whole world trust(Don't trust, verify!), gives fare opportunities to everyone in world. Which will encourage everyone contributed to automation, research, fare distribution.

> BTC is born from libertarians ideals. It was never about get rich fast. I really hope BTC continue on its goal.

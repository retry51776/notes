# Hardware
- Brain Process `Brain function is localized`
  - Association Areas `link memory to sensor or processor; key thing we develop in life`
    - remember
    - thinking
    - learning
  - Neocortex `aka Human Brain`
    - Frontal lob `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
      - speaking
      - planning
      - judging
      - abstract
    - Parietal lob `nerve input processor;`
    - Occipital lob `vision;`
    - Temporal lob `logic; pattern; memory;`
      - comprehension
      - sound
      - speech

  - Limbic System `aka Mammal Brain; IMO logic here, but about children level logic`
    - Pituitary Gland `look /bio/human`
    - Hypothalamus `look /bio/human`
    - Amygdala `memory consolidation & emotion`
      - Emotion
        - Sad
        - Disgust
        - Happy
        - Surprise
        - Anger
        - Fear
      - Episodic Memory `Remember events`
      - Procedural Memory `How to do things; Habits?`
    - Hippocampus `learning and memory; `
      - Semantic Memory `knowledge`

  - Reptilian brain `aka Reptile Brain: basic body functions`
    - Thalamus `Info Router`
    - Cerebellum `Movement Control`
      - Flight
      - Fight
    - Survival System `circulation, breathing, heart, digest`

below head
- Moveability `both Brain & Muscle & Control System`
  - Carry, Move other object
  - Self Moveability
- Digestive system
- Reproductive system



# Software/Driver

# Sensation
> Absolute Threshold of sensation `min stimulation needs to register 50% of the time`

> It's not absolute changes matter, but relative change.

## Touch
> Touch sensation is 4 sensations
- pressure
- warmth
- cold
- pain

>> Touch is VERY important sensation. `first sensation to commutate between others, develop trust?`
## Kinesthesis
> senses body movement and position
## Vestibular
> monitor head's position and balance


# Perception
> It's also requires brain some area to process it.

> Perception is believing.

> Perception is where context influence brain's process; where culture start influence decision

> Perception is step where a lot information is dropped.`aka lead to MISTAKE;`
> > There for is important to find bad preconception

- Figure `focus`
- Ground `other surrounding`
Group things by
- proximity
- continuity
- closure

## Vision Perception
- Depth Perception
- Monocular cues `size of what we see`
  - relative size and height
  - linear perspective
  - texture gradient
  - interposition

## Motion Perception
> easy to fool

## Consciousness | Self Perception
> our awareness of ourselves and environment
> Plan; Consequences; Reflection;

Consciousness state:
### Awake
### Sleeping `recuperation; growth; mental function;`
> Rapid eye movement (REM)

> Adrenal Glands release cortisol
> Pineal Gland release melatonin
> Alpha `aka wake`
> (NREM-1)
> (NREM-2)
> (NREM-3) delta wave
> REM
### Hypnosis
> calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have **heightened concentration and focus**, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion.
> 
> Trust?
### Drug Alter
- Depressant
- Stimulants
- Hallucinogens

- Extravert `Frontal lob`
- Caring `Frontal lob + Parietal lob + Limbic System + `
- Reliable `Frontal lob + Limbic System/Habits`
- Creative `Thalamus| lobs able make info across multiple lobs?`
- Leadership
- Conceptual `Temporal lob + Occipital lob`
- Tough
- Humble
- Determined

# Association Areas
> sleep develop Association Areas; `why we dream`

> Association Learning links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning

> Association Areas is where **mistake** happens too, but **easier to fix** compare to **preconception**

> Operant conditioning `aka training w positive and negative feedback`
## Selective Attention `aka focus stimulus`
> 

# Emotion & Memory
6 Primary Emotions? `Is all memory have 6 tags?`

# Conclusion
> We must be aware which brain level we operating on;
> > Logic only works in higher level.
>
> Try to resolve problem is wrong level is similar to programming.

> I think we should use Parenting model to train Limbic & reptilian brain

> Memory & Emotion are the same thing
> > If you want to memorize something, tie them to a feeling
> 
> Out of 6 Primary Emotions: 4 consider negative, while 2 maybe positive;
> > Are we suppose to be unhappy more?

- Limbic System + Frontal lob `Happy person`
- Parietal lob + Occipital lob `sport`
- Temporal lob `smart`

# Framework
> Some well know framework/relationship that can apply in different areas;

## Discrete math
1. Proven & Disprove theory `Proposition, Negation, Conjunction ...etc`
2. Truth Table / Logic Tree
3. Boolean Logic


## Encounter Problem
- choice 1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.


- choice 2. Avoid problem.
  - 2.1 Change path without change desires
  - 2.2 Change path & desires


- choice 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
  - 3.1 listen other | observe problem
    - 3.1.1 bad decision `already know what went wrong`
      - missing knowledge;
      - lack of training;
      - improve process;
    - 3.1.2 missing skill `have an idea of what need to learn`
      - lack of ability;
      - lack of resource;
    - 3.1.3 missing ability `root to multiple problems`
      - remove preconception; `identify preconception cause problem, use logic to prove its issue`
      - lack of value; `don't care because don't value`
      - lack of senses; `i can't fix blind; any work around?`
  - 3.2 validate problem
    - 3.2.1 can you reproduce problem?
    - 3.2.2 can you limited variables?
    - 3.2.3 can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
  - 3.3 communication
    - 3.3.1 If any one using reptilian brain, delay communication
    - 3.3.2 Establish connection by confirm their feeling, share your feeling
  - 3.4 design solution
    - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember compromise
    - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement
  - 3.5 training
    - 3.5.1 repeatation is the key
  - 3.6 explore alternative
    - 3.6.1 what if?
  - 3.7 conclusion
    - 3.7.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson
    - 3.7.2 Other subject/problem have inspiration from new conclusion
    - 3.7.2 Add conclusion to log
  - 3.8 develop trust
    - 3.8.1 Trust yourself to resolve problem
    - 3.8.2 Other trust you to resolve problem


- choice 4. Get others resolve problem for you.
  - 4.1 Reliance on others
  - 4.2 Observe & go to #3

## Bio ecosystem
1. Bio diversity
2. Auto balance between hunter & pray
3. Producer -> Consumer -> xth Consumer
4. Network effect

> Tiger is very powerful, but also very limited in their living area; They must live in area w enough food support them; Everything has its constrain/tradeoff.

## Human brain & relationship
1. logic(slow but accurate) vs emotion(fast but guess)
2. parenting(cortex parenting cerebrum)
3. Connection before correction
4. Decision fatigue

## Neural network
1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs backward propagation
2. Structure determent algorithm
> I wish to be expert in this area, this will reveal so much about human brain; Our main bottleneck & how to bypass them

## difficulty w Complexity
1. There is no solution, only tradeoff.
2. Decision fatigue.
3. Cause and effect are difficulty to determent, but correlation is easier to detect.
> We must make decision because we can't have everything.
> We have limited capability to make decision.
> There are so many decisions in complex problem/product;
> 
> People uses trust`brand, representatives` and simplify`abstraction, metaphor, framework` to work around complex problem;
> 
> Engineer uses correlation to guess, improve solution.
> There isn't a scientific way to predict solution for complex problem in future`past result isn't prove`.
> We assume investor willing to put their money on the line in aggregate result in good prediction.

## Drive to the future
1. The road is NOT always straight, with limited visibility.
2. Driver have some control of car.
3. Car have momentum from past acceleration.

> Just because we currently heading in wrong direction, doesn't mean it's wrong path;
>
> World ending predictions always wrong because they assume future won't change, and their calculation based on current direction and momentum;

> The most important thing we can do are
> > 1. Increase visibility as far as we can. `aka better prediction`
> > 2. Increase car controllability. `aka better production tech, storage tech, better resp system`
> > 3. Have a backup system.

> Better not only mean cost less, but more reliable, diverse, less unknown impact;
> Also that means we may not want to drive as fast as we can.

## Mathematics theory
> Mathematics theory(Principal) build on top of axioms(Value);
>
> Mathematician by creativity think(Ability) + math tools(Principal & Value) => develop algorithm(Skill) to resolve problem(Mistake)
>
> Formula(Skill) is condensed version of Mathematics law/theory(Principal);

## Common Movie design pattern
1. Shows misleading ending first, then start from beginning, then show end with a twist.
2. Try to search for some secret that is sitting in plain sight.
3. Ending with religion stuff.
4. Unchangeable destiny.
5. At first technology matter the most, but at the end relationship are most important.
6. Puzzle movie.
7.

    - Frontal lob `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
    - Parietal lob `nerve input processor`
    - Occipital lob `Vision`
    - Temporal lob `logic; pattern; memory`

  - Limbic System `aka Mammal Brain; IMO logic here, but about children level logic`
    - Emotion

  - Carry, Move other object
  - Self Moveability

> We must be aware which brain level we operating on; Try to keep them higher level as much as you can. Each Level has its logic;

> Neocortex is super complex, IDK i have enough skill to get good framework

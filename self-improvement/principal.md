# Strong Beveled

## Life is a video game
> You (player) have to make decision what you want to collect(or not collect), where you explore, which equipments to carry(RIGHT equipments > more equipments), which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Value, Ability, Skill`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your PROBLEM SET (game).
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.


## Decision framework
> Sense`see, feel, hear, how much these sense matter in your environment` develop Value`personal value`
> 
> Ability`Moveability, Learn, Practices, Reflection, Recognize Pattern` develop Skill`Ride a bike, Program w Python, Program w C...`
> 
> Problem / [Skill + Value] = Decision `Encounter problem, your decision dependence on what skill & value you already have`

> Principal is condense version`common denominator` of skill.
> > IDK Reflection should be Ability or skill; My guess they both recursively create each other make classify hard
>
> Framework is collection of Principals.


- 4 choice handle problem
> 1. Don't recognized/ignore problem.
> 2. Change path to avoid problem.
> 3. Self improvement to resolve problem.
> 4. Get others resolve problem for you.

- Pain + Reflection = Progress
> Mistake causes pain`one of sense`; Mistake indices there is a problem; It's up to player which 1 out of 4 ways to handle it.
>> If you choose #3; You may unlock a game equipment`principle, skill, money, or lesson`; It's up to you to collect`or not collect` this new equipment

>> Principle has different level, you can REFINE principle to get better principle; Or keep using level 1 principle`early child conclusion` you collected; 

- Everything has its mechanic;
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.

- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.

- A good framework(Top-down view) is critical.
> A good framework should able steelman argument for everyone POV;
> 
> IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of frameworks`TODO: to list frameworks & write it down, but framework is something hard to describe in text`.

- Great power comes great responsibility`spider-man`
> IMO: Most people problem is they want power `money, position` without responsibility;
> It's easy envy rich, because you don't have to pay its responsibility.

## Recognize Pattern
- Most things have recursive property
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict;
> Solution/Hack around by delay response`aka cool off period`;

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you

- Top down view VS bottom up view

- Intelligence is under same law as supply`often too much focus` and demand`often overlook`.

- Addiction is a progressive narrowing of the thing bring you pleasure. A good life is a progressive expansion of the things to bring your pleasure.

- Decision fatigue
> Branch exist, representative exist; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer`, we will make great improvement.


# Weak Beveled
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.
- Repetition training is most effective way to change.
- Change your path is easier than change what your desire.

# Common Judgement
- When leader w strong ego, their ability is ceiling of their team.

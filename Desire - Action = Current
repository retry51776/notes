# Psychology Definitions

## Awareness

> Awareness can be broken down into **Attention** → **Sensation** → **Perception**.  
> If you lack some awareness, it is likely that your personal values do not prioritize it. Prioritize personal value, then learn skills to improve perception.

### Cue

> Any perception that triggers a habit loop.

## Desire

> There is a natural psychological desire within us to belong and to have power.  
> Dopamine ≈ desires; 80 % of neuronal cells have receptors for dopamine.  
> Humans can act on their desires, but cannot will them away; it is easier simply to avoid the cue that triggers desire.

> Remember: power comes with responsibility. When you desire something, ask yourself whether you are ready for that responsibility.

## Reward

> Reward or satisfaction is **different** from desire.  
> Serotonin ≈ happiness & satisfaction.  
> The raphe nuclei are clusters of neurons located in the brainstem and are the primary source of serotonin projections to the rest of the brain.

# Action

- 1. **Risk & Reward Analysis** (experience.md#risk-reward)  
  - From Past Experience (#experience)  
  - From Logic Deduction
- 2. **Choice of Four Actions**
  - a. Do nothing.  
    - a.1 Don't recognize the problem.  
    - a.2 Ignore the problem.
  - b. Avoid the problem.  
    - b.1 Change path.  
    - b.2 Change desires.
  - c. [Self‑improvement](#self-improvement).  
  - d. Outsource the problem.  
    - d.1 Reliance on people.  
    - d.2 Reliance on machines.

## Experience

> Experiences (experience.md) are accumulated states—`RNN hidden state`—of the CNS process.  
> There is no such thing as a believer or a non‑believer; only many past experiences that move you from 0.01 % non‑believer to 99.99 % believer.

## Self Improvement

### Diagnose

- **3.1 Diagnose** – “listen to others; reexamine experience”
  - **3.1.2 Desire** – *Belong or Power?*  
    - Increase:  
      - Re‑prioritize personal value.  
      - Convert emotion to motivation.  
    - Decrease:  
      - Avoid (see #evaluation-2-avoid-problem).  
      - Remember that power comes with responsibility.
  - **3.1.2 Awareness**  
    - *Attention?* – Re‑prioritize personal value; improve process design; increase training.  
    - *Sensation?* – Any workaround? “I can’t fix blind.”  
    - *Perception?* – Biological perception? “workaround?”  
      Psychological perception? [Study mammal brain](psychology.md#3-perception) (internal / external).
  - **3.1.3 Experience** – Add experience, avoid trigger, edit association.
- **3.2 Validate Diagnose**
  - **3.2.1 Start from problem** – Can you reproduce the problem? List possible causes, then eliminate them.
  - **3.2.2 Start from ability** – Can you add tests, logs, monitoring to narrow root causes? Can you limit variables? Can you execute potential solutions to see results?

### Design

- **3.3 Communication**
  - **3.3.1 Connection before correction**  
    - External: confirm their feelings, share your feelings.  
    - Internal: trust yourself, i.e., the mammal brain (nervous.md#mammal-brain).
- **3.4 Design Process**
  - **3.4.1 If another party is involved, remember to compromise.**  
  - **3.4.2 Solutions can be incremental improvements.**

### Implementation

- **3.5 Training**
  - **3.5.1 Confirm improvement.**  
  - **3.5.2 Repetition is key.**
- **3.6 Conclusion**
  - **3.6.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson.**  
  - **3.6.2 Explore alternatives.**  
  - **3.6.3 Document adjustments of experience** – e.g., skill, conclusion, principle, personal value.  
  - **3.6.4 Develop trust** (internal & external).

> Things I believe will happen in 20 years.

1. Weather control
   1. Reduce or guide hurricane/tornado damage by blocking sunlight.
   2. Rain control – China already does it; as space‑tech prices drop, I expect long‑term solutions to develop.
   3. Increase or decrease city sunlight by up to 50 %; this could reduce heating & cooling needs and possibly lower cancer risk.
2. Cellular agriculture
   1. No longer need large corn/soybean farms; glucose will be produced in factories like gasoline.
   2. Reduction of animal farms – cell‑based production may become cheaper than chicken.
3. AI takeover

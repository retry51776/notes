Test data is as important as test itself

> Testing code vs Testing features

## Consider
- Size?
- Freshness?
- difficulty
- bureaucracy
- skill level
- cost?
## Terms
- test conrol input
- literal values
- output references

## collision

> multiple user uses same resource

- solution
    > restrict test access

    > deploy new container

    > make DB clone

    > serial instead parall

My name is Terry, I'm Fullstack Web Dev at a medical company. You can think of us as turbo tax for nursing home. I works with their analysis product.  from react/redux to express server, flask micro server, design sql/no sql DB, design bussiness workflow, to GCP deployment. Obsively it's NOT a highly well structure like most small company. I love evnet driven architure, because it's fault tolerance, easier to scale, decoupleing, break up code base.

I'm focus on workflow, backend python engine, db design,Âµ

a bit understand sql plannern & execute engine,
but most bussinees logic is simple iteror scan

```
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    cost, profit = float('inf'), 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < cost:
            cost = price
        if price - cost > profit:
            profit = price - cost
    return profit
```

## Teamwork Philosophy

### Core Ideas

- Transparency accelerates learning and builds trust.  
- Collaborative progress (“go together”) outweighs individual speed.  
- Process quality is more valuable than a single correct answer.  
- “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”  
- The goal itself is less important than the execution path; mastering navigation and trade‑offs matters most.

> Consider goals within a consensus framework: rapid re‑adjustment of consensus is crucial because desired consensus may differ from actual need.

- Establish goals and rules in advance; create a transparent environment.  
- A better process outweighs a correct answer.

> Most parental mistakes stem from valuing the *correct behavior* **OVER** the child’s psychological process.  
> Focus on continuous improvement of processes, not perfection.

## Parenting

> There are three types relationship between parent, child, and problem.

### Positive discipline
>
> [child + parent] `aka parent is same team as child` solves the problem.  
> *Good outcome:* develop the child's ability to work in a team, build self‑worth, and improve problem‑solving skills.

### Authoritarian family
>
> child solves [problem + parent]; the child doesn’t trust the parent, or the parent becomes part of the problem.  
> *Good outcome:* the child is forced to develop excellent problem‑solving skill.

### Permissive family
>
> parent solves [child + problem] `aka parent took problem ownership away from child`.  
> *Good outcome:* a happy child? (uncertain)

Start with the parent's solution and process for the child. As the child grows, let them take more responsibility for **solution development**. Focus on improving the process, not the solution itself.

### Parenting Ideas

- Connection before correction.  
- Encourage the child to solve problems.  
- Hint at a problem or suggest a solution, but don’t demand they copy the answer; it’s the child's choice to implement it or not.  
- Ensure a feedback system works: the parent's job is to regulate feedback, not be the feedback itself.  
- Acknowledge progress and praise the child’s solution.  
- A tantrum indicates the child is in survival mode.  
- Self‑esteem is self‑trust; children must develop this themselves—not be given it. We can help a child develop self‑trust.

- The root cause of many issues is the parent’s demand/response. If there is already a “good” child, differences often arise because the parent no longer responds as they did with the first good child, or the parent's demands have changed.

### IMO

> Companies today are like predators; instead of bodies, companies capture your attention. Those who protect their younger ones from these predators survive.

### Games

- Toddler Telephone: use kids to tell other parents a message.

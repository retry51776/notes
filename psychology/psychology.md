# Psychology
> Psychology are ways of thinking and behaving.
> > IMO: Psychology is similar to chip design; Workload & resource determent optimal design.
> 
> > I assumed brain assign neuron functionality based on neuron location` connections = computation`, sensor location, output location, supply routes, and workflow design? Is brain balance between least neuron and capture reality?
> > 
> > I assume brain also use near memory computation design, there fore memory & functions are localized.
> 
> > Each cortex lob are registers; Association Areas is CPU`more like FPGA`; some cortex also acts as storage;


# 1. Attention
> Right now I beveled attention trigger by Basal ganglia neuron fires in burst mode.

> Most often problem is within this layer;

> Attention is a multiplier of sensation

> [Personal Value](README.md#personal-value) is a important variable in Attention.

Selective Attention

Way to change attention?
- Reprioritize Personal Values
- reduce distraction
  - avoid trigger
  - change path/environment
- **increase the consequences**
  - increase reward
  - increase/create punishment
- training

# 2. Sensation
> Sensations are the raw data that our brains receive from the outside world.
> 
> Absolute Threshold of sensation `min stimulation needs to register 50% of the time`
>
> It's not absolute changes matter, but relative change.

## Touch
> Touch is VERY important sensation. `proven by Harry Harlowâ€™s Wire Monkey Mother Experiment`
> > First sensation to commutate between others, develop trust?
> 
> > Sex is just extreme form of touch

Touch sensations:
- pressure
- warmth
- cold
- pain

## Vision
> Convolutional neural network(CNN)
> 
> 90% info input by vision;

> Threhold: > 60ms we can see; < 40ms we can't see; 30ms is 100% can't see.

- Primary Visiual Area(V1)
  - Parvocellular layers (4 P Layers) `color, detail, still, slow`
  - Magnocellular layers (2 M Layers) `detect motions`
- Dorsal stream `process spatial info`
- Ventral stream `process shape & color`
  - motion(MT)
  - shape(LOC)
  - color(CC), 
  - face(Fusiform Face Area)
  - places(Parahippocampal Place Area) `shape of envirenment`
  - body(Extrastriate Body Area)
- Hippocampus
  - Place Cell(Here cell) `fire rapidly, regardless direction, 3D place field`
  - Direction Cell
  - Grid Cell
  - Boarder Cell



- Depth Perception
- Monocular cues `size of what we see`
  - relative size and height
  - linear perspective
  - texture gradient
  - interposition

## Hearing
> It's useful, but not required perception.

**Smell**
> Directly to brain, only sense that by pass Thalamus.

**Taste**
> Processed by the gustatory system.

**Kinesthesis** `senses body movement and position`

**Vestibular** `monitor head's position and balance`


# 3. Perception
> Perception is brain interpret the information from our senses. `aka sensory development`
> 
> Perceptions are core skills that develop other skills;
> > Ex: baby's vision up side down; peekaboo game; We learn how to walk because we practices Proprioception;
> 
> Perception can break into 2 major categories: [Biology Perception](#biology-perception) & [Psychology Perception](#psychology-perception);
>
> > Perception is where a lot information is dropped.`aka lead to MISTAKE;`
> 
> It is crucial to identify under performing perceptions, but it can be challenging to detect missing perceptions.


## Psychology Perception
> Ability to read (Self & Other) body language through [body expression](#mammal-brain).
> > Women usually out perform men on reading body language.


## Biology Perception
> Biology Perception processed by reptilian brain;
### Nociception
> the perception of pain;
> 
> Trigger to reflection

### Radiation
> sense of color, sense of moods associated with color, sense of temperature

### Thermoception
> the sense of heat

### Proprioception
> the perception of body awareness


# 4. Experience
> [**Past Experience**](README.md#experience) project your [**Action**](README.md#action)

> Sleep resets [Association Areas](#brain); `why we dream; Neuron trys to fire all its synapse; That's why a get new ideas after sleep;`
> > Older people sleep less. That is reason as we get older, we harder to change the way we think.

> Association Learning links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning
> > Close mind people has strong preconception`from memory` that they can't change association;

> Association Areas is where **mistake** happens too, is easier to noticed but **harder to change** compare to **Perception**
> > Mistake/Forget is not a bug, but a feature enable people combine/decouple different ideas.

> unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`

**ways to change association**
1. avoid
   1. increase awareness
   2. avoid trigger
2. dilution
   1. create new memory replaced association
   2. reedit memory
3. Operant conditioning `aka training w positive and negative feedback`
4. reevaluate associated subject
   1. replace subject`or behavior`
   2. break down subject`aka divide & conquer`


## Vision Association
> Often there is something blocked part of view, yet we still able detected blocked item;
> 
> Vision perception associates logic & pattern to interpret;
> > We develop top-down view & bottom-up view from vision.

## Logic Association
> IDK there is single area do all logic. `maybe Temporal lob?`

> Association **first**, then Logic **second**. `aka we are not always logical being`

## Memory Association
> Memory & Emotion are related.
> > If you want to memorize something, tie them to a feeling

> Memory will break into different aspects, then store its corresponse areas of brain.

### Working memory
- Capacity: 7 items +-2
- Duration: 20-30s
- Encoding: Visual and auditory last longer than verbal or written information
  - The positional effect
  - rehearsal `aka repeat`
  - chunking `aka organized memory`
  - mnemonic devices
    - image `aka picturize memory`
    - pegword `aka use story`
    - location
    - Acronym
  - Self-Referencing
  - Spacing `aka repeat study in large time gape`
- Interference: Memory will interfered w each other
- Transfer to long-term memory by Hippocampus
> Basic mechanics of short term memory is neuron associate different signal together. Increase voltage to create more neurotransmitters; The receptor will increase surface area to capture more neurotransmitters;

### Long Term Memory
- Semantic Memory `knowledge`
- Episodic Memory `Remember events by sensation`
- Procedural Memory `How to do things`
> Long Term Memory & Emotion are created by Hippocampus, and store in different areas in cortex;
> 
> Long term memory is neuron develop new terminal directly connects to other neuron; serotonin cause neuron grew new terminal;


## Body Language
> aka Non-verbose communication;

> Our bodies are similar to cars, with speech being the equivalent of honking and non-verbal communication being like the turning signals and headlights. To reach our destination, we need to learn how to navigate social interactions in the same way we learn traffic patterns.

Books:
- The Definitive Book of Body Language
- Lie Detection 101
- What every body saying
- Atomic Habit

Rules:
1. Closed vs Expand posture.
2. The act of using a pacifier is similar to scratching an itch in the brain.
   - a. Observes frequency changes.
3. Body position.
4. Gravity Effect.
5. Look for congruence. `aka find contradiction`
   1. speech vs expression.
   2. speech vs body position
   3. left vs right; top vs bottom;

Tips:
1. Practice paused & think. `aka inaction`
2. Read gestures in clusters.
3. Read gestures in context.
4. Eye contact similar to service health check.

> Look away while talking is for reduce distraction for clear thought.

# Conclusion
> We must be aware which brain level we operating on;
> > Logic only works in higher level.
>
> > When we talk to a person, imagine talking to 2 people, the logical one and the emotional one `connection before correction`
>
> Try to resolve problem in wrong level is similar fixing bug in wrong area.
>
> Brain function is localized, that is reason when we doing same thing we get tried & bored` feedback system avoid over use`. Also the same reason we need diversify desires.

> Maybe we should split brain by application: long term memory, short term memory, emotion, through, action controller, movement, pattern seperation, pattern completion

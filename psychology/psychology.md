# Questions:
- What/How is Brain Process overall architecture?

- What is ego/pride? something relates to connection? NN input weight? Is confident self-perception or experience?

- How Hippocampus works? Maybe is help AI development.

- Is all memory have 6 emotional tags?

- Out of 6 Primary Emotions: 4 consider negative, while 2 maybe positive; Are we suppose to be unhappy more?

# Brain
`Brain function is localized`
- [Central Nervous System](./../biology/anatomy.md#central-nervous-system-cns)
  - **Human Brain** `aka Neocortex; includes mammal brain; 4 lobs + Association Area + Insular cortex; cortex often 6 layers`
    - **Association Areas** `link memory to sensor or processor; key thing we develop in life`
      - correlation
      - learning
      - thinking `reroute info to logic area`
    - **Frontal lob** `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
      - speaking
      - planning
      - judging
      - abstract
      - smell sensation
    - Parietal lob
      - touch sensation `nerve input processor;`
    - Occipital lob
      - vision sensation`vision; its associate logic area to understand concealed information`
    - **Temporal lob** `logic; pattern; memory;`
      - sound sensation
      - speech
      - comprehension
    - Insular cortex
      - taste sensation



  - **Mammal Brain** `includes Reptilian brain; IMO logic here, but about children level logic;`
    - [Pituitary Gland](../biology/anatomy.md#endocrine-system)
    - Hypothalamus `regulate basic needs through hormones: sleep, sex, eat, rest;`
    - Amygdala `flight or fight`
    - Thalamus `relay station`
    - Hippocampus `convert short term memory into long term memory; Only create memory;`

  - Reptilian brain `aka Reptile Brain: basic body functions`
    - Midbrain `quick sensation process trigger body's reflexes`
    - Pons `regulation of sleep and wakefulness`
    - Medulla `control the muscles of the head and neck`
    - Cerebellum `Movement Control`
    - Brain Stem `breathing, heart, blood pressure, wakefulness;`
- [Peripheral Nervous System](./../biology/anatomy.md#peripheral-nervous-system-pns)


# 1. Attention
> Most often problem is within this layer;

> Attention is a multiplier of sensation

> [Personal Value](README.md#personal-value) is a important variable in Attention.

Selective Attention

Way to change attention?
- Reprioritize Personal Values
- reduce distraction
  - avoid trigger
  - change path/environment
- **increase the consequences**
  - increase reward
  - increase/create punishment
- training

# 2. Sensation
> Sensations are the raw data that our brains receive from the outside world.
> 
> Absolute Threshold of sensation `min stimulation needs to register 50% of the time`
>
> It's not absolute changes matter, but relative change.

## Touch
> Touch is VERY important sensation. `proven by Harry Harlowâ€™s Wire Monkey Mother Experiment`
> > First sensation to commutate between others, develop trust?
> 
> > Sex is just extreme form of touch

Touch sensations:
- pressure
- warmth
- cold
- pain

## Vision
> Convolutional neural network(CNN)
> 
> 90% info input by vision

- Depth Perception
- Monocular cues `size of what we see`
  - relative size and height
  - linear perspective
  - texture gradient
  - interposition

## Hearing
> It's useful, but not required perception.

**Smell**
> Directly to brain, only sense that by pass Thalamus.

**Taste**
> Processed by the gustatory system.

**Kinesthesis** `senses body movement and position`

**Vestibular** `monitor head's position and balance`


# 3. Perception
> Perception is brain interpret the information from our senses.
> 
> Perceptions are skills; `aka sensory development`
> > Ex: baby's vision up side down; peekaboo game; We learn how to walk because we practices Proprioception;
> 
> Perception can break into 2 major categories: [Biology Perception](#biology-perception) & [Psychology Perception](#psychology-perception);
>
> > Perception is where a lot information is dropped.`aka lead to MISTAKE;`
> 
> > It's very important to find under perform Perception;
> 
> > It's very **hard to noticed** missing Perception;


## Psychology Perception
> Ability to read (Self & Other) body language through [body expression](#mammal-brain).
> > Women usually out perform men on reading body language.


## Biology Perception
> Biology Perception processed by reptilian brain;
### Nociception
> the perception of pain;
> 
> Trigger to reflection

### Radiation
> sense of color, sense of moods associated with color, sense of temperature

### Thermoception
> the sense of heat

### Proprioception
> the perception of body awareness


# 4. Experience
> [**Past Experience**](README.md#experience) project your [**Action**](README.md#action)

> Sleep develop [Association Areas](#brain); `why we dream`
> > Older people sleep less. Maybe sleep is like committing changes in the brain.

> Association Learning links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning
> > Close mind people has strong preconception`from memory` that they can't change association;

> Association Areas is where **mistake** happens too, is easier to noticed but **harder to change** compare to **Perception**
> > Mistake/Forget is not a bug, but a feature enable people combine/decouple different ideas.

> unaware preconception? `identify preconception cause problem, what causes association, how to reduce association`

**ways to change association**
1. avoid
   1. increase awareness
   2. avoid trigger
2. dilution
   1. create new memory replaced association
   2. reedit memory
3. Operant conditioning `aka training w positive and negative feedback`
4. reevaluate associated subject
   1. replace subject`or behavior`
   2. break down subject`aka divide & conquer`


## Vision Association
> Often there is something blocked part of view, yet we still able detected blocked item;
> 
> Vision perception associates logic & pattern to interpret;
> > We develop top-down view & bottom-up view from vision.

## Logic Association
> IDK there is single area do all logic. `maybe Temporal lob?`

> Association **first**, then Logic **second**. `aka we are not always logical being`

## Memory Association
> Memory & Emotion are related.
> > If you want to memorize something, tie them to a feeling

### Working memory
- Capacity: 7 items +-2
- Duration: 20-30s
- Encoding: Visual and auditory last longer than verbal or written information
  - The positional effect
  - rehearsal `aka repeat`
  - chunking `aka organized memory`
  - mnemonic devices
    - image `aka picturize memory`
    - pegword `aka use story`
    - location
    - Acronym
  - Self-Referencing
  - Spacing `aka repeat study in large time gape`
- Interference: Memory will interfered w each other
- Transfer to long-term memory by Hippocampus
> Basic mechanics of short term memory is neuron associate different signal together. Increase voltage to create more neurotransmitters; The receptor will increase surface area to capture more neurotransmitters;

### Long Term Memory
- Semantic Memory `knowledge`
- Episodic Memory `Remember events by sensation`
- Procedural Memory `How to do things`
> Long Term Memory & Emotion are created by Hippocampus, and store in different areas in cortex;
> 
> Long term memory is neuron develop new terminal directly connects to other neuron; serotonin cause neuron grew new terminal;


# Mammal Brain
> [Mammal Brain](#brain) workflow: **safety** >  **body language** > **perceive emotions**
> 
> Default Response order: Freeze > Run > Fight

> Mammal Brain process same sensation as Human Brain, but have faster response than Human Brain.
>
> Mammal Brain uses [Peripheral Nervous System](./../biology/anatomy.md#peripheral-nervous-system-pns) directly express body language.
> 
> > All mammals have similar emotions.

> IMO
> > Mammal brain is another kid within us;
> 
> > Mammal brain includes [Reptilian brain](#reptilian-brain) and [Peripheral Nervous System](./../biology/anatomy.md#peripheral-nervous-system-pns).
> 
> > We should use [Parenting model](parent.md) to train mammal brain.
> > Connection before correction.

## Primary Emotions
> aka Mammal Brain Process
- Sad
- Disgust
- Happy
- Surprise
- Anger
- Fear

## Body Language
> aka Mammal Brain Output; Non-verbose communication;

> Our bodies are similar to cars, with speech being the equivalent of honking and non-verbal communication being like the turning signals and headlights. To reach our destination, we need to learn how to navigate social interactions in the same way we learn traffic patterns.

Books:
- The Definitive Book of Body Language
- Lie Detection 101
- What every body saying

Rules:
1. Closed vs Expand posture.
2. The act of using a pacifier is similar to scratching an itch in the brain.
   - a. Observes frequency changes.
3. Body position.
4. Gravity Effect.
5. Look for congruence. `aka find contradiction`
   1. speech vs expression.
   2. speech vs body position
   3. left vs right; top vs bottom;

Tips:
1. Practice paused & think. `aka inaction`
2. Read gestures in clusters.
3. Read gestures in context.

> Look away while talking is for reduce distraction for clear thought.
>
> 

## Reptilian brain
> Survival Stuff; I think of Reptilian brain as driver for hardware.

Consciousness state:
- Awake
- Drug Alter `Depressant; Stimulants; Hallucinogens`
- Hypnosis `calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have **heightened concentration and focus**, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion.`
- Sleeping `recuperation; growth; mental function;`

# Conclusion
> We must be aware which brain level we operating on;
> > Logic only works in higher level.
>
> > When we talk to a person, imagine talking to 2 people, the logical one and the emotional one `connection before correction`
>
> Try to resolve problem in wrong level is similar fixing bug in different area.
>
> Brain function is localized, that is reason when we doing same thing we get tried & bored` feedback system avoid over use`. Also the same reason we need diversify desires.

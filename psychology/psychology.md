# Psychology

> Here are some notes that not been consolidate.

> **IMO:** Psychology is similar to chip design; workload & resources determine optimal design.

> I assumed the brain assigns neuron functionality based on neuron location, connections = computation, sensor location, output location, supply routes, and workflow design. Is the brain balanced between using the fewest neurons and capturing reality?  
> I assume the brain also uses near‑memory computation design; therefore memory & functions are localized.

> Each cortical lobe is a register; association areas act like a CPU (more like an FPGA). Some cortex also serves as storage.

## 1. Attention

> Right now I believe attention is triggered by basal ganglia neurons firing in burst mode.  
> Most often the problem lies within this layer.  
> Attention multiplies sensation.  

> **Personal Value** (`README.md#personal-value`) is an important variable in attention.

### Selective Attention

#### Ways to change attention

- Prioritize personal values
- Reduce distraction  
  - Avoid triggers  
  - Change path/environment
- **Increase the consequences**  
  - Increase reward  
  - Increase/create punishment
- Training

## 2. Sensation

> Sensations are the raw data that our brains receive from the outside world.

> Absolute threshold of sensation: *minimum stimulation needed to register 50 % of the time*.

> It's not absolute changes that matter, but relative change.

### Touch

> Touch is a very important sensation (proved by Harry Harlow’s wire‑monkey mother experiment).  
> > First sensation to communicate between others; develops trust?  

> Sex is just an extreme form of touch.

**Touch sensations**

- Pressure
- Warmth
- Cold
- Pain

### Vision

> Convolutional neural network (CNN)  
>> Model parameter sharing to avoid overfitting.

Ninety percent of information input comes from vision.

**Thresholds:** > 60 ms we can see; < 40 ms we cannot see; at 30 ms vision is completely blocked.

- Primary Visual Area (V1)  
  - Parvocellular layers (4 P layers): `color, detail, still, slow`  
  - Magnocellular layers (2 M layers): `detect motion`
- Dorsal stream: processes spatial info
- Ventral stream: processes shape & color  
  - Motion (MT)  
  - Shape (LOC)  
  - Color (CC)  
  - Face (Fusiform Face Area)  
  - Places (Parahippocampal Place Area): `shape of environment`  
  - Body (Extrastriate Body Area)
- Hippocampus  
  - Place cells: fire rapidly, regardless of direction, with a 3‑D place field  
  - Direction cells  
  - Grid cells  
  - Border cells

**Depth perception**

**Monocular cues** (`size of what we see`)

- Relative size and height
- Linear perspective
- Texture gradient
- Interposition

### Hearing

> It’s a useful sense, but not essential for perception.

### Smell

> Directly reaches the brain; it is the only sense that bypasses the thalamus.

### Taste

> Processed by the gustatory system.

### Kinesthesis

> Senses body movement and position.

### Vestibular

> Monitors head position and balance.

## 3. Perception

> Perception is the brain interpreting information from our senses (also known as sensory development).  
> Perceptions are core skills that enable the development of other abilities.  
> > Example: a baby’s vision is upside‑down; peekaboo games; we learn to walk because we practice proprioception.

Perception can be divided into two major categories: **Biological perception** and **Psychological perception**.

> Perception is where a lot of information is dropped (`aka lead to mistakes`).  
> It is crucial to identify under‑performing perceptions, but it can be challenging to detect missing ones.

### Psychological perception

Ability to read one's own and others' body language through [body expression](#mammal-brain).  
> Women usually outperform men at reading body language.

### Biological perception

Processed by the reptilian brain.

#### Nociception

The perception of pain; a trigger for reflection.

#### Radiance perception

Sense of color, mood associations with color, and perceived temperature.

#### Thermoception

The sense of heat.

#### Proprioception

Perception of body awareness.

## 4. Experience

> [**Past experience**](experience.md) projects onto **action** (`README.md#action`).  

Sleep re-normalize neuron; this explains new ideas after sleep.  

Association learning links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning.  
> Closed‑mind people have strong preconceptions (`from memory`) that they can't change association.

Association areas are where mistakes also occur; they are easier to notice but harder to change compared to perception.  
> Mistake/forget is not a bug, but a feature enabling people to combine/decouple different ideas.

**Ways to change association**

1. **Avoid**  
   1. Increase awareness  
   2. Avoid triggers
2. **Dilution**  
   1. Create new memory to replace the association  
   2. Re‑edit memory
3. **Operant conditioning** (`aka training with positive and negative feedback`)
4. **Reevaluate associated subject**  
   1. Replace subject (`or behavior`)  
   2. Break down subject (`aka divide & conquer`)

### Visual association

Often a portion of the view is blocked, yet we can still detect the hidden object. Vision perception associates logic & pattern to interpret; we develop top‑down and bottom‑up views from vision.

### Logic association

I don’t know if there is a single area that handles all logic—perhaps the temporal lobe?  
Association comes first, then logic follows (i.e., we are not always purely logical beings).

### Memory association

Memory & emotion are related.  
> If you want to memorize something, tie it to a feeling.

Memory breaks into different aspects, which are stored in corresponding brain areas.

#### Working memory

- Capacity: ~7 ± 2 items
- Duration: 20‑30 s
- Encoding: visual and auditory information lasts longer than verbal or written information  
  - Positional effect  
  - Rehearsal (`aka repeat`)  
  - Chunking (`aka organized memory`)  
  - Mnemonic devices  
    - Image (`aka picturize memory`)  
    - Pegword (`aka use story`)  
    - Location  
    - Acronym  
  - Self‑referencing  
  - Spacing (`aka repeat study over a large time gap`)
- Interference: memories interfere with each other
- Transfer to long‑term memory via the hippocampus

> The basic mechanism of short‑term memory involves neurons associating different signals. Increasing voltage creates more neurotransmitters; receptors expand their surface area to capture them.

#### Long‑term memory

- Semantic memory (`knowledge`)
- Episodic memory (`remember events by sensation`)
- Procedural memory (`how to do things`)

> Long‑term memory and emotion are generated by the hippocampus and stored in different cortical regions.  
> Long‑term memory forms as neurons develop new terminals that connect directly to other neurons; serotonin promotes this growth.

### Body language

Also known as non‑verbal communication.

Our bodies are similar to cars, with speech being the equivalent of honking and non‑verbal communication like turning signals and headlights. To reach our destination, we need to learn how to navigate social interactions just as we learn traffic patterns.

**Books**

- *The Definitive Book of Body Language*
- *Lie Detection 101*
- *What Every Body Is Saying*
- *Atomic Habits*

**Rules**

1. Closed vs. expanded posture.
2. Using a pacifier is analogous to scratching an itch in the brain.  
   - Observes frequency changes.
3. Body position.
4. Gravity effect.
5. Look for congruence (`aka find contradiction`)  
   1. Speech vs. expression.  
   2. Speech vs. body position.  
   3. Left vs. right; top vs. bottom.

**Tips**

1. Practice pausing & thinking (`aka inaction`).
2. Read gestures in clusters.
3. Read gestures in context.
4. Eye contact is similar to a service health check.

> Looking away while speaking reduces distraction and promotes clearer thinking.

## Conclusion

We must be aware of which brain level we are operating on.  
> Logic only works at higher levels.

> When we talk to a person, imagine talking to two people: the logical one and the emotional one (`connection before correction`).

Trying to resolve a problem at the wrong level is similar to fixing a bug in the wrong area.

Brain function is localized; this explains why repetitive tasks lead to fatigue and boredom (a feedback system avoids overuse). It also underscores the need to diversify desires.

Perhaps we should partition the brain by function: long‑term memory, short‑term memory, emotion, thought, action control, movement, pattern separation, and pattern completion.

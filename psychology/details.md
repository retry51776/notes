## main parts of Limbic System

- Amygdala: This almond-shaped structure is involved in emotional processing and the formation of memories associated with emotional events.

- Hippocampus: This structure is important for the consolidation of new memories and the navigation of spatial environments.

- Olfactory bulb: This structure is involved in the processing of smells and is located at the base of the brain.

- Thalamus: This structure serves as a relay station for sensory information, sending signals from the sensory organs to the appropriate areas of the cerebral cortex.

- Hypothalamus: This structure plays a role in the regulation of various functions, including hunger, thirst, and body temperature. It is also involved in the production of hormones that regulate the body's stress response.

- Fornix: This is a bundle of fibers that connects the hippocampus to other structures in the brain, including the septum, thalamus, and mammillary bodies.

- Cingulate gyrus: This structure is located in the cerebral cortex and is involved in the regulation of emotional and cognitive processes.

- Septal nuclei: These nuclei are involved in the regulation of behavior and are located in the septum, a thin structure that separates the left and right halves of the brain.



## main part of Reptilian brain

- Brainstem: This is the lower part of the brain that is responsible for controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.

- Cerebellum: This is a small structure located below the cerebral hemispheres that is involved in the control of movement and balance.

- Spinal cord: This is a long, tubular structure that runs from the brain down through the center of the body. It is responsible for transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body.

- Reticular formation: This is a network of nerve fibers that runs through the brainstem and is involved in the regulation of sleep, arousal, and attention.

- Basal ganglia: These are a group of structures located deep within the brain that are involved in the control of movement and the initiation of voluntary actions. Also store & process habits.



## memory

Memory is not stored in any single location in the brain. Instead, it is thought to be distributed across a network of brain regions that are involved in the consolidation and retrieval of memories.

One key region involved in memory is the hippocampus, which is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the consolidation of new memories, particularly those related to spatial navigation and personal experiences. It receives input from various brain regions and sends signals to the neocortex (the outer layer of the brain) for long-term storage.

Other brain regions that are involved in memory include the amygdala, which is involved in the processing of emotional memories, and the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in the retrieval of memories and decision-making.

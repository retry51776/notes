## Memory

- Sensory Memory
- Short Term Memory
- Long Term Memory `from hippocampus to neocortex`
  - Declarative Memory
    - Read
      - emotion enhancer `cue sequences triggers emotion, need loading time`
      - without emotion enhance less recall memory
    - Write
      - emotion enhancer `by amygdala, increase LTP`
  - Procedural memory
    - `by striatum`

[**Emotions**](nervous.md#mammal-brain) are optional ENHANCES MECHANISM(both write & read effect) to bind fragments of declarative memories together, creating a coherent narrative. `Trigger for Memory Chains`

> Read: Memory cue trigger whole memory section. Emotions at the time of retrieval influence which memories are accessed, creating a "glue" between current affective states and past experiences.

> Write: Surprise/Strong emotion proven to strong write memory effects in psychology. Emotion can even reinforce memories BEFORE emotion triggered(backfill past memory).

>> When recall memory, initially emotion enhance effect & time has exponential relationship(load past memory, then somehow amygdala release some enhance effect ).

> Animals needs fast responses(≈ query + business_logic) base off memory(large data), since business_logic ≈ past_experiences + biological_experiences, responses_action ≈ query_memory.

All mammals have 6 Primary Emotions:

- Sad
- Disgust
- Happy
- Surprise
- Anger
- Fear

> Life is collection of habits (process modes) derived from a collection of declarative & procedure memory.
>
>> We don't have timeline memory, just more dense memory patches in recent time, and sparse memory patches in older time.
>
>> The older we get, time fly faster. Time did NOT move faster, but we form LESS memory patches! which makes us have less changes/learning because learning is compression from memory patches.

## Risk Reward

<strong>Natural is about Risk & Reward Management.</strong>

Five parts in Risk Reward Analysis

- Player `Each player has its own value system & its own risk reward preference`
- Action `Choices in game; each choices with its own Risk Reward outcome`
  - Bad player usually because unaware possible action, or stuck same actions.
- Turn `Opportunities that player can choice action; Ex: stop risk/game.`
- Risk `Risk can combine together, 'gate keeper' of reward.`
- Reward `Reward usually correlate to risk; because (high reward & low risk) draw players which reduce reward; (low reward & high risk) repeal player to increase reward.`

> > Ex1: More power(reward) comes with more responsibility(risk)
>
> > Ex2: Cost(risk) vs Benefit(reward)
>
> > Ex3: animals reproduction
>
> > Ex4: There is no solution, only tradeoff.
>
> > Ex5: Witty speaker, instead of talk directly(low risk, low reward), they took a far route(high risk, high reward).
>
> > Ex6: Most intelligence animals will PAUSE & THINK & WORRY when there is huge reward in front of them WITHOUT EFFORT/RISK. Because intelligence have natural instinct to measure risk & reward. Huge reward usually indicate huge risk.

> Why rich get richer? It's not rich get richer. It's those with resource able to handle more risk in order capture more reward.

> Society doesn't pay people by their hard work, we get paid by the risk we handle.

> Ex: we are risk 20+ years time for education. In a way, we risk 20+ year to be not productive, for increase productive rest of our live. We assume there is food & safety for 20+ years, and we live more than 50+ years to capture rewards.

> Often chinese history put cause/effect of history event on somebody. We should avoid that, they just play an odd game. Failure doesn't make their decision bad, success doesn't justify their actions.

> I don't like to promote charity, karmas, or deed. Every action should measure by risk & reward. It's rational/good to consider reward even if reward is NOT yours. Charity is promote selfless action. IMO we should promote ALL action have positive reward, regardless beneficiary.
>> Ex: Education is mostly self benefic, yet it's most likely positive reward for self & society. So even education is "selfish", we should still promote it.

Poker is one of best game about Risk & reward. Many well develop theory to analysis risk & reward.

## Personal Value
>
> **Personal Value** are ways we evaluate the internal & external action & result. Or some dimension to measure risk & reward. `aka KPI for evaluation; Or NN Loss Functions;`
> > It is rare for individuals to change their personal values because these values are typically developed during early childhood.
>
> > The new personal value require compatibility with existing personal value & conclusion.

## Conclusion
>
> **Conclusion** is recognized pattern derived from past observation.
> > It's difficult to change our conclusion because it's based on many different results, which makes it hard to dilute the existing conclusion.
>
> > We are always be `bias` because we all only experiences subset of realities.
>
> > Conclusion is guidance for action.
>
> > The very reason we love story, story lead to conclusion.
`aka Recognized patterns.`

- All knowledge build on top assumptions, aware assumption can be invalidated.

- Everything has its mechanic.

> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.

- Great power comes great responsibility. `from spider-man`

> IMO: Common problem is people's desire for power, money, and position without assuming responsibility.
>
> > Parenting should base on equal respect; Make kid understand more power comes with more responsibility.

- Most things have recursive property.

> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- Unconsciousness < Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you

> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Intelligence is equilibrium of supply `often too much focus` and demand `often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue

> The reason for Brand, Company, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.

- What you DESIRE is DIFFERENT than what you NEED.

- Often structure determent properties.

- All evolutionary ideas are breaking our assumptions.

> Ex: Einstein E=mc^2 means energy and mass is same thing.
> Ex: Newton establish science.

- writing < speech < though < awareness < body < physic < spacetime

- Assume supply is not limited. Quality vs Price has exponential relationship, Quantity vs Price has logarithm relationship.

## Skill
>
> **Skills** are learned [**Action**](README.md#action);
> > Procedural Memory. Most people able obtain.
>
> > Both [verbal and nonverbal communication](nervous.md#mammal-brain) skills will improve [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception).

## Principal
>
> **Principals** are core beliefs that guide actions & [explain other conclusions](experience.md#conclusion);
> > Metaphor: algorithms transform unknown equation into solvable equation
>
> > Principal won't have conflict w other principals `under some premises`.
>
> > IMO discrete math has many basic Principal, should be taught in HS.

- Discrete math

1. Proven & Disprove theory `Proposition, Negation, Conjunction ...etc`
2. Truth Table / Logic Tree
3. Boolean Logic

`Self principals:`

- Transparency accelerate learning process.

> The very reason I write this repo.

- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.

> Connection before correction. `by Jane Nelsen`

- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.

> Most people happy when they have new ability.
>
> That's why kid way happier than adult, kid unlock new ability more frequents than adult.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

> Change your path is easier than change what your desire.
>
> Just like poker, you can't change past; But readjust risk & reward model can improve future games.

- Repetition training is most effective way to change. `Not talking about memory, just habits.`

- We have two minds, the rational mind `human brain/cortex`, and the emotional mind `mammal brain`.

> Rational mind just pattern recognition machine.
>
> People communication often neglected emotional mind`both self & other`.
>
> We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict.
> > Hack around by delay response. `aka cool off period`

- Pain + Reflection = Progress

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;

`Team work principals:`

- If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.

- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.

- Establish goal & rule in advanced, and transparent environment.

- Better process is more valuable than correct answer.

> Most parent mistakes root from parent value correct behavior OVER child's psychology process.
>
> Don't go for perfect answer. Rather focus on constance improvement of existing process.
>
> Train kid risk & reward model.

- 2 approaches to solution

> Top down approach
> > List possible causes, then start eliminate causes by logic.
>
> Bottom up approach
> > Start from what I can do, build a module at a time, then start combine module.

- When leader w strong ego, leader's ability is ceiling of their team.

### Frameworks
>
> **Frameworks** are collection of principals & conclusions to explain reality. `aka mental construction of reality.`
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
>
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
>
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](experience.md#framework)
>
> > It is rare, but sometime new framework to lead to the development of new personal values.

## Life Framework
>
> Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
>
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
>
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
>
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
>
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
>
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
>
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.

## Society Analogy
>
> Society can be compared to a rope, with the population representing its thinness and the length of time being its length. Individuals are like fibers within this rope, carrying the patterns, experiences, and knowledge `aka force`. These force `pattern/experience/knowledge` can either pass on to next generation, or pass on to friends & families, or coworker; Natural diaster is like external force will sudden hit the rope; Rope always has strands that lead to nowhere.

### Science pyramid

1. Mathematics
2. Physics
3. Chemistry
4. Biology
5. Psychology
6. Sociology

## Bio ecosystem

1. Bio diversity
2. Auto balance between hunter & pray
3. Producer -> Consumer -> xth Consumer
4. Network effect

> Tiger is very powerful, but also very limited in their living area; They must live in area w enough food support them; Everything has its constrain/tradeoff.

### Brain Characteristic

1. Rational(slow but accurate) vs emotion(fast but guess)
2. Parenting(cortex parenting cerebrum)
3. Connection before correction
4. Decision fatigue

## Neural network

1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs backward propagation
2. Structure determent algorithm

> I wish to be expert in this area, this will reveal so much about human brain; Our main bottleneck & how to bypass them

## Difficulty w Complexity

1. There is no solution, only tradeoff.
2. Decision fatigue.
3. Cause and effect are difficulty to determent, but correlation is easier to detect.
4. As a system get more complex, changes in system requires more complexity(to narrow down exact part).

> We must make decision because we have limited resources.
> We have limited capability to make decision.
> There are so many decisions in complex problem/product;
>
> People uses TRUST brand/representatives to simplify(abstraction) to work around complex problem;
> > In 2020 we have a lot debate about platform immunity; fundamentally problem is product owner makes decisions for user because user can't/won't/avoid make all decision.  
>
> Engineer uses correlation to guess, improve solution.
> There isn't a scientific way to predict solution for complex problem in future`past result isn't prove`.
> We assume investor willing to put their money on the line in aggregate result in good prediction.

> If complexity in system makes changes difficult, and there is no way around it(IMO). Then this explain why life has dead.
> That's why I always value simplicity in system.

## Drive to the future

1. The road is NOT always straight, with limited visibility.
2. Driver have some control of car.
3. Car have momentum from past acceleration.

> Just because we currently heading in wrong direction, doesn't mean it's wrong path;
>
> World ending predictions always wrong because they assume future won't change, and their calculation based on current direction and momentum;

> The most important thing we can do are
> >
> > 1. Increase visibility as far as we can. `aka better prediction`
> > 2. Increase car controllability. `aka better production tech, storage tech, better resp system`
> > 3. Have a backup system.

> Better not only mean cost less, but more reliable, diverse, less unknown impact;
> Also that means we may not want to drive as fast as we can.

## Mathematics theory
>
> Mathematics theory(Principal) build on top of axioms(Value);
>
> Mathematician by creativity think(Ability) + math tools(Principal & Value) => develop algorithm(Skill) to resolve problem(Mistake)
>
> Formula(Skill) is condensed version of Mathematics law/theory(Principal);

## Common Movie design pattern

1. Shows misleading ending first, then start from beginning, then show end with a twist.
2. Try to search for some secret that is sitting in plain sight.
3. Ending with religion stuff.
4. Unchangeable destiny.
5. At first technology matter the most, but at the end relationship are most important.
6. Puzzle movie.

- More clues as movie goes on;
- Fragmentation; Ex: West World season 1;

7. Tessellation; Most classic literary have tessellation; There are some side characters with few details; Yet indicates they follow same rule & pattern that main character follow. Ex: 红楼梦 皇帝>贾府>赖管家 (Aka recursive story)

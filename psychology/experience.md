## Opinion

**Summary:**  

> Opinions are patterns formed from past observations and experiences.  
>
> They are hard to change because they integrate many life events, leading to entrenched beliefs.  

- There is no solution, only trade‑off.
- Everything has its mechanic. Understand the mechanics by either collecting statistics or applying logic.
- Most things have a recursive property (e.g., wealth, knowledge, ability, social skill).
- Structure often determines properties.
- We (including AI) are always biased because each of us experiences only a subset of reality.

- All evolutionary ideas challenge our assumptions.  
  > *Einstein*: E = mc² → energy and mass are equivalent.  
  > *Newton*: established modern science.
>
### China Opinion

- China is a role‑based society. Your responsibility and power come from your role rather than directly from personal choice. Hierarchical relationships arise from role assignments—for example: 君君臣臣，父父子子. 打地主
- Chinese Culture attempts to lock up human nature(不尊重人性). Ex: Buddhist can't marry nor eat meat; Communism eliminate personal profit;孔子:克己复礼;
- Chinese history often attributes the cause or outcome of events to specific individuals. We should avoid this view—it. Life is similar to poker, perfect actions & still lose that hand. A failure does not necessarily mean a decision was wrong, just as success does not automatically justify an action.

### Psychology Opinion

- The brain is analogous to a computer: biology (hardware) + psychology (software).
- Two “minds”: the rational mind (cortex) and the emotional mind (more primitive mammalian brain).
- Human nature seeks **belonging** and **power**.
- Instinct(Personality) just understanding of risk & reward in EARLY childhood, which embedding into brain as default thinking.
- Don't trust what people said, observed their action.
- Memory exists as discrete patches; fewer patches with age make time feel faster.  
  > We don’t have a continuous memory timeline; we have denser memory patches for recent events and sparser ones for older times.  
  >> As we age, time seems to fly faster. Time does not actually speed up; rather we form fewer memory patches, which reduces the amount of change or learning because learning is the compression of those patches.  
  > Perhaps this also explains why we need less sleep as we age—sleep may normalize neuronal firing strength and frequency.  

- Decision fatigue is a real limitation.
- You cannot connect the dots when looking forward (the result has not yet occurred); you can only connect them retrospectively.
- Intelligence is an equilibrium between supply (often over‑focused) and demand (often overlooked).

### Economic Opinion

- Assuming unlimited supply, quality vs. price follows an exponential relationship, whereas quantity vs. price follows a logarithmic relationship.

- Trade‑off between Redundancy–Efficiency in production.
  - Redundancy Ex: China High Speed Rail over‑built due to insufficient validation. Military Industry.
  - Efficiency Ex: Textile, Automotive, Datacenter, centralize 1950 -> 2020

  - Production is centralize, inelastic;
  - Consumption is decentralize, localized, volatile;

- Technological progress fuels production efficiency, which concentrates markets; concentrated markets centralize consumption, creating the scale and resources that drive further technological progress.
  - Technological Progress → Production Efficiency → Market Concentrate → Consumption Concentrate → Technological Progress

## Philosophy

**Summary:**  

> Philosophy provides a way for evaluating actions, risks, and rewards.  
>
> It is typically formed early in life and guides decision‑making and trust building.

### Personal Philosophy

> Personal value is philosophy that individual understand in early childhood, which embedded into early layers of brain(similar to instinct).

**Core Ideas:**  

- Treat life as Bayesian risk‑reward management.  
- Prioritize satisfaction over fleeting happiness.  
- Trust hierarchy: Unconscious < Aware < Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you.  
- **Bayesian Statisticians** – treat life as risk‑reward management using Bayesian updating.
- Seek satisfaction, not fleeting happiness.  
  > Most people are happy when they acquire new abilities; children are often happier because they unlock abilities more frequently.

- Focus should be proportional to your ability to effect change.  
  What you **DESIRE** is different from what you **NEED**.

- Guide actions with philosophy to develop consistent **trust** between self and others.

- Discrete mathematics contains many fundamental principles; it should be taught in high school.

- **Don’t trust; verify.**

- The past cannot change; only reflection can inform future intent.

- Changing your path is easier than changing what you desire.  
  *Analogy*: In poker you can’t change the dealt cards, but you can adjust risk‑reward strategy.

#### Approaches to Solution

- **Top‑down** – List possible causes, then eliminate by logic.
- **Bottom‑up** – Start with what you can do, build modules incrementally, then combine them.
- When a leader’s ego is strong, the leader becomes the ceiling for the team’s ability.

### Practical Guidelines

**Actionable Advice:**  

- Keep decision‑making processes visible.  
- Favor collaboration and robust processes over speed.  
- Use Bayesian updates to evaluate risk and reward.  
- Verify before trusting; manage decision fatigue.  

> Actionable advice distilled from the philosophical sections above.

- **Transparency**: Keep decision‑making processes visible to all stakeholders; it accelerates learning and builds trust.
- **Collaboration over Speed**: Prioritize long‑term collective progress (“go together”) rather than short‑term individual speed.
- **Process Over Correctness**: Value a robust, repeatable process more than arriving at the “right” answer on the first try.
- **Risk & Reward Evaluation**: Before acting, assess both potential gains and possible downsides; use Bayesian updating to refine estimates as new information arrives.
- **Verification before Trust**: Adopt a “don’t trust; verify” mindset—seek evidence before accepting claims.
- **Decision‑Fatigue Management**: Limit the number of high‑stakes decisions in a short period; automate or delegate routine choices where possible.
- **Iterative Learning**: Treat failures as data points for Bayesian updates; slow down when high‑impact evidence appears to allow proper integration.
- **Goal Setting**: Define clear goals and rules upfront, then remain flexible to adjust consensus as new information emerges.

## Frameworks

**Summary:**  

- Frameworks are collections of philosophical principles that explain reality.  
- Good frameworks can model diverse subjects and often fall into top‑down or bottom‑up approaches.  

> **Frameworks** are collections of philosophy that explain reality.  

> *A good framework should be able to steelman (or explain) every subject’s action (“people’s POV”).*  
> *Frameworks usually fall into two types: Top‑down vs. Bottom‑up.*  
> *Most things in life can fit into a small number of frameworks.*  
> *Rarely, a new framework can lead to the development of a new philosophy.*

### Bayesian Statisticians

**Highlights:**  

- Life is a collection of habits; validation (past experiences) underpins trust.  
- Consensus stability depends on breadth of validation, information accuracy, and decision speed.  

> **Biological nature is about risk & reward management with Bayesian statisticians.**

- Life is a collection of habits.  
  - Habit and trust share the same nature: artifacts of past experiences.
- **Changes & Learning**  
  - Slow down when high‑impact evidence appears; give the Bayesian update process time to integrate it.  
  - Older organisms have less flexibility because new experiences must be diluted among many past ones.
- All interactions (communication, trade, between persons, pets, countries) require **validation** – the sum of past experiences that shape current expectations.  
  - “Connection before correction.” — *by Jane Nelsen*

> **Consensus** is common individual validation; war occurs when there is no consensus on both sides.

>> ![Personality Landscape](./static/PrinciplesProfile.png)
>>> ← dismiss validation;
>>>
>>> → value validation;
>>>
>>> ↑ seek external validation;
>>>
>>> ↓ rely on internal validation;

> `Consensus Stability ≈ (Breadth of Validation) × (Accuracy of Information Flow) / (Decision‑making Speed)`

- Democracy increases the number of individual validations, making consensus more resilient.  
- Dictatorship has a small group consensus, enabling rapid decisions but with unstable consensus (e.g., rapid policy changes in China).

> Trust is having validation of your past. Trusting yourself requires remembering & reflecting on your past.

- Before you persuade others, have you been validated by others?  
  > 曹操问贾诩关于“立储”: To persuade others, your opinion/conclusion should be based on **their** life experiences.

- **Desired Consensus = Goal**  
  Example: 刘邦斩丁公 – different goals at different times. At war, desired consensus is to defeat 项羽; after victory, the desired consensus shifts to loyalty toward 刘邦.

- **Local Consensus = Culture**
- Only pain & reflection will remove **False Validation**

  <summary>Risk‑Reward Examples</summary>

- People often desire power, money, and position without assuming responsibility.  
  - Parenting should be based on equal respect; teach kids that more power comes with more responsibility.  
  - Great power → great responsibility (spider‑man).  
  - Cost (risk) vs. Benefit (reward).  
  - Animal reproduction as a natural risk‑reward system.  
  - Too Good to be True Instinct in most mammals. Intelligent animals pause & think when a huge reward appears without effort/risk because intelligence instinctively measures risk.

- Why do the rich get richer? Those with resources can handle more risk to capture greater reward.

- Society pays for risk handling, not merely hard work.

- Education: we risk decades of time to increase lifelong productivity; society provides safety nets during that period.

- Charity vs. self‑interest: actions should be evaluated on net positive reward, regardless of who benefits.

- Poker exemplifies risk‑reward analysis; starting hand selection is critical.

### Life Is a Video Game

**Highlights:**  

- Player (you) chooses resources, equipment, and relationships.  
- Excess “equipment” can hinder progress; time is the ultimate resource.  

> You, the *player*, decide what to collect, explore, equip, and which relationships to form.  
> The character may acquire “equipment” (money, skill, principle, philosophy).

- Too much equipment becomes counterproductive—like junk in a hoarder’s house. The right principle is determined by your **PROBLEM** (“game”).  
- Money amplifies true nature: *Money is like a mushroom in Super Mario, making you bigger.*  
- The hardest problem is the “player‑control bug” → mental disability.  
- Lack of education & pattern recognition = player doesn’t know the game rules.

> Happiness comes from the player, not the character. Many confuse the two.  
> The only resource a player has is time.

### Society & Time

**Highlights:**  

- Society functions like a rope: population = thickness, time = length.  
- Individuals are fibers transmitting opinions and knowledge across generations.  

> Society ≈ rope: population = thickness, time = length. Individuals are fibers carrying opinions, experiences, and knowledge. Forces can pass to next generations, friends, families, or coworkers. External shocks (natural disasters) are like sudden forces on the rope; some strands lead nowhere.

### Science Pyramid

**Structure:**  

1. Mathematics → 2. Physics → 3. Chemistry → 4. Biology → 5. Psychology → 6. Sociology  
1. Mathematics  
2. Physics  
3. Chemistry  
4. Biology  
5. Psychology  
6. Sociology  

### Bio Ecosystem

**Key Elements:**  

- Biodiversity, auto‑balance of predator‑prey, trophic levels, network effects.  

1. Biodiversity  
2. Auto‑balance between hunter & prey  
3. Producer → Consumer → … → Apex predator  
4. Network effect  

> Tigers are powerful but limited by habitat; every organism faces constraints/trade‑offs.

### Brain Characteristics

**Core Traits:**  

- Rational (slow, accurate) vs. Emotional (fast, heuristic).  
- Cortex “parenting” of the cerebrum; connection before correction; decision fatigue.  

1. Rational (slow, accurate) vs. Emotional (fast, heuristic)  
2. Parenting (cortex “parenting” of the cerebrum)  
3. Connection before correction  
4. Decision fatigue  

### Neural Network Analogy

**Core Traits:**  

- Loss/mistake and forward/backward propagation mirror learning processes.  
- Structure determines algorithmic behavior.  

1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs. backward propagation  
2. Structure determines algorithm  

> Mastery of these concepts could unlock deeper understanding of the human brain and its bottlenecks.

### Difficulty with Complexity

**Key Points:**  

- No perfect solutions, only trade‑offs; decision fatigue limits capacity.  
- Correlation is easier to detect than causation; abstractions simplify complexity.  

1. No solution, only trade‑offs.  
2. Decision fatigue.  
3. Cause ↔ effect is hard; correlation is easier to detect.  
4. More complex systems require more complexity to modify specific parts.

> We must decide because resources are limited; our decision‑making capacity is also limited.  

- People use trusted brands/representatives as abstractions to simplify complexity.  
  - Example: platform immunity debates (2020) – product owners make decisions for users who cannot/choose not to decide themselves.  
- Engineers rely on correlation to improve solutions; there is no perfect scientific prediction for future complex problems.  
- Investors collectively fund ventures, enabling better predictions.

> If system complexity hinders change and there’s no workaround, it explains why life includes death. Hence, simplicity is valuable.

### Drive to the Future

**Key Points:**  

- Visibility, controllability, and backup systems enhance resilience.  
- Faster speed isn’t always optimal; balance cost, reliability, and diversity.  

1. The road is not always straight; visibility is limited.  
2. Drivers have some control of the car.  
3. Cars have momentum from past acceleration.

> Heading in a “wrong” direction now doesn’t mean the path is wrong forever.  
> End‑of‑world predictions fail because they assume a static future.

**Key actions for resilience**

1. Increase visibility (better prediction).  
2. Improve controllability (better production, storage, response systems).  
3. Maintain backup systems.

> “Better” means lower cost **and** higher reliability, diversity, and reduced unknown impact. We may not want to drive at maximum speed.

### Mathematics Theory

**Core Idea:**  

- Mathematics builds on axioms (philosophy) to create principles and algorithms that solve problems.  

> Mathematics theory (Principle) builds on axioms (Philosophy).  

- Mathematicians combine creativity (ability) + tools (principle & philosophy) → algorithms that resolve problems (mistakes).  
- A formula is a condensed version of a mathematical law/theory (principle).

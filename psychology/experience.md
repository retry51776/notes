## Opinion
>
> An **opinion** is a recognised pattern derived from past observations.
> > It’s difficult to change our opinions because they are based on many different life experiences, which makes it hard to dilute an existing opinion.
>
> > We are always biased because we each experience only a subset of reality.
>
> > That is why we love stories; stories lead to conclusions.
`aka Recognized patterns.`
>
> Ex: `import this #python's opinion`

### Memory Patch
>
> We don’t have a continuous memory timeline; we have denser memory patches for recent events and sparser ones for older times.
>
>> As we get older, time seems to fly faster. Time does not actually speed up; rather we form fewer memory patches, which reduces the amount of change or learning because learning is the compression of those patches.
>
> >Perhaps this also explains why we need less sleep as we age. My theory is that sleep normalises neuronal firing strength and frequency.”

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.

- Understand the mechanics by either collecting statistics or applying logic.

- You cannot connect the dots when looking forward (because the result/conjunction point has not yet occurred); you can only connect them when looking backward (after the result has happened).

- Decision fatigue

- Intelligence is an equilibrium between supply (often over‑focused) and demand (often overlooked).

- Most things have recursive property.

> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- Structure often determines properties.

- Assuming supply is unlimited, quality versus price follows an exponential relationship, whereas quantity versus price follows a logarithmic relationship.

- We have two ‘minds’: the rational mind (the human cortex) and the emotional mind (the more primitive mammalian brain).

- We develop heuristics first—optimising based on statistical bias—and later create algorithms, i.e., frameworks that explain all possible paths.

## Philosophy
>
> Philosophy is a way of evaluating internal and external actions and results—a dimension for measuring risk and reward (akin to KPIs or neural‑network loss functions).
>
> > It is rare for individuals to change their philosophy because it is usually formed in early childhood.
>
> > Philosophy is guidance for action.
>
> > A new philosophy must be compatible with the existing one and its conclusions.

- Everything has its mechanic.

- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.

> Most people are happy when they acquire a new ability.
>
> That’s why children are often happier than adults; children unlock new abilities far more frequently.

<hr/>

- Unconsciousness < Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you `Just different levels of trust`

> This is the reason for brands, companies and representatives: if we solve or expand this human bottleneck—our reliance on computers—we could achieve a huge improvement.

- Your focus should be proportional to your ability to effect change.

- What you DESIRE is DIFFERENT from what you NEED.

- All evolutionary ideas challenge our assumptions.

> Ex: Einstein E=mc^2 means energy and mass is same thing.
> Ex: Newton establish science.

> > Guide your action with philosophy is develop consistent/TRUST between others and yourself.
>
> > Principal won't have conflict w other principals `under some premises`.
>
> > IMO discrete math has many basic Principal, should be taught in HS.

- Don't trust, verify.

- Discrete math

1. Proven & Disprove theory `Proposition, Negation, Conjunction ...etc`
2. Truth Table / Logic Tree
3. Boolean Logic

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

> Change your path is easier than change what your desire.
>
> Just like poker, you can't change past; But readjust risk & reward model can improve future games.

## Quotes

- Repetition training is most effective way to change. `Not talking about memory, just habits.`

> Rational mind just pattern recognition machine.
>
> People communication often neglected emotional mind`both self & other`.
>
> We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict.
> > Hack around by delay response. `aka cool off period`

- Pain + Reflection = Progress

## Frameworks
>
> **Frameworks** are collection of philosophy to explain reality.
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
>
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
>
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](experience.md#framework)
>
> > It is rare, but sometime new framework to lead to the development of new philosophy.

### Trust & Habit are past artifacts of Risk & Reward

> <strong> Biology nature is about Risk & Reward Management.</strong> Habit and Trust are the same nature, summary of past experiences.
>> Any living thing, as older they get less flexibility/change. It's because new opinion is hard to dilute too many past experiences.

- Connection before correction. `by Jane Nelsen`

- Life are collections of habits.

- All interactions(communication, trade, between person, pets, countries) requires **validation**. Validation, in its broadest sense, is the sum of past experiences that shape current event's expectation.
>
>> **Consensus** is common individual validation, war happens when no consensus both side.
>
>> Trust is have validation of your past. Trust yourself prerequisite is remember & reflect on your past.
>
> Before you persuade others, have you been validate by others?

  <summary>Risk Reward Examples</summary>

Five parts in Risk Reward Analysis

> IMO: Common problem is people's desire for power, money, and position without assuming responsibility.
>
> > Parenting should base on equal respect; Make kid understand more power comes with more responsibility.

- Player `Each player has its own philosophy & its own risk reward preference`
- Action `Choices in game; each choices with its own Risk Reward outcome`
  - Bad player usually because unaware possible action, or stuck same actions.
- Turn `Opportunities that player can choice action; Ex: stop risk/game.`
- Risk `Risk can combine together, 'gate keeper' of reward.`
- Result `Action requires time, other causes => result. Result correlate to risk.`
- Trust `Sum of past relevant result`

> > Ex1: Great power comes great responsibility. `from spider-man`
>
> > Ex2: Cost(risk) vs Benefit(reward)
>
> > Ex3: animals reproduction
>
> > Ex4: There is no solution, only tradeoff.
>
> > Ex5: Witty speaker, instead of talk directly(low risk, low reward), they took a far route(high risk, high reward).
>
> > Ex6: Most intelligence animals will PAUSE & THINK & WORRY when there is huge reward in front of them WITHOUT EFFORT/RISK. Because intelligence have natural instinct to measure risk & reward. Huge reward usually indicate huge risk.

> Why rich get richer? It's not rich get richer. It's those with resource able to handle more risk in order capture more reward.

> Society doesn't pay people by their hard work, we get paid by the risk we handle.

> Ex: we are risk 20+ years time for education. In a way, we risk 20+ year to be not productive, for increase productive rest of our live. We assume there is food & safety for 20+ years, and we live more than 50+ years to capture rewards.

> Often chinese history put cause/effect of history event on somebody. We should avoid that, they just play an odd game. Failure doesn't make their decision bad, success doesn't justify their actions.

> I don't like to promote charity, karmas, or deed. Every action should measure by risk & reward. It's rational/good to consider reward even if reward is NOT yours. Charity is promote selfless action. IMO we should promote ALL action have positive reward, regardless beneficiary.
>> Ex: Education is mostly self benefic, yet it's most likely positive reward for self & society. So even education is "selfish", we should still promote it.

Poker is one of best game about Risk & reward. Many well develop theory to analysis risk & reward. Picking your starting hands are the most critical.

### Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
>
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Philosophy`;
>
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
>
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
>
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
>
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
>
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.

### Society & Time
>
> Society can be compared to a rope, with the population representing its thinness and the length of time being its length. Individuals are like fibers within this rope, carrying the opinion, experiences, and knowledge `aka force`. These force `pattern/experience/knowledge` can either pass on to next generation, or pass on to friends & families, or coworker; Natural diaster is like external force will sudden hit the rope; Rope always has strands that lead to nowhere.

### Science pyramid

1. Mathematics
2. Physics
3. Chemistry
4. Biology
5. Psychology
6. Sociology

### Bio ecosystem

1. Bio diversity
2. Auto balance between hunter & pray
3. Producer -> Consumer -> xth Consumer
4. Network effect

> Tiger is very powerful, but also very limited in their living area; They must live in area w enough food support them; Everything has its constrain/tradeoff.

### Brain Characteristic

1. Rational(slow but accurate) vs emotion(fast but guess)
2. Parenting(cortex parenting cerebrum)
3. Connection before correction
4. Decision fatigue

### Neural network

1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs backward propagation
2. Structure determent algorithm

> I wish to be expert in this area, this will reveal so much about human brain; Our main bottleneck & how to bypass them

### Difficulty w Complexity

1. There is no solution, only tradeoff.
2. Decision fatigue.
3. Cause and effect are difficulty to determent, but correlation is easier to detect.
4. As a system get more complex, changes in system requires more complexity(to narrow down exact part).

> We must make decision because we have limited resources.
> We have limited capability to make decision.
> There are so many decisions in complex problem/product;
>
> People uses TRUST brand/representatives to simplify(abstraction) to work around complex problem;
> > In 2020 we have a lot debate about platform immunity; fundamentally problem is product owner makes decisions for user because user can't/won't/avoid make all decision.  
>
> Engineer uses correlation to guess, improve solution.
> There isn't a scientific way to predict solution for complex problem in future`past result isn't prove`.
> We assume investor willing to put their money on the line in aggregate result in good prediction.

> If complexity in system makes changes difficult, and there is no way around it(IMO). Then this explain why life has dead.
> That's why I always value simplicity in system.

### Drive to the future

1. The road is NOT always straight, with limited visibility.
2. Driver have some control of car.
3. Car have momentum from past acceleration.

> Just because we currently heading in wrong direction, doesn't mean it's wrong path;
>
> World ending predictions always wrong because they assume future won't change, and their calculation based on current direction and momentum;

> The most important thing we can do are
> >
> > 1. Increase visibility as far as we can. `aka better prediction`
> > 2. Increase car controllability. `aka better production tech, storage tech, better resp system`
> > 3. Have a backup system.

> Better not only mean cost less, but more reliable, diverse, less unknown impact;
> Also that means we may not want to drive as fast as we can.

### Mathematics theory
>
> Mathematics theory(Principal) build on top of axioms(Philosophy);
>
> Mathematician by creativity think(Ability) + math tools(Principal & Philosophy) => develop algorithm to resolve problem(Mistake)
>
> Formula is condensed version of Mathematics law/theory(Principal);

## Common Movie design pattern

1. Shows misleading ending first, then start from beginning, then show end with a twist.
2. Try to search for some secret that is sitting in plain sight.
3. Ending with religion stuff.
4. Unchangeable destiny.
5. At first technology matter the most, but at the end relationship are most important.
6. Puzzle movie.

- More clues as movie goes on;
- Fragmentation; Ex: West World season 1;

7. Tessellation; Most classic literary have tessellation; There are some side characters with few details; Yet indicates they follow same rule & pattern that main character follow. Ex: 红楼梦 皇帝>贾府>赖管家 (Aka recursive story)

## Team
>
> Teamwork Philosophy

- Transparency accelerate learning process.

- If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.

- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.

- Establish goal & rule in advanced, and transparent environment.

- Better process is more valuable than correct answer.

> Most parent mistakes root from parent value correct behavior OVER child's psychology process.
>
> Don't go for perfect answer. Rather focus on constance improvement of existing process.
>
> Train kid risk & reward model.

- 2 approaches to solution

> Top down approach
> > List possible causes, then start eliminate causes by logic.
>
> Bottom up approach
> > Start from what I can do, build a module at a time, then start combine module.

- When leader w strong ego, leader's ability is ceiling of their team.

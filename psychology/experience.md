## Opinion
>
> An **opinion** is a recognized pattern derived from past observations.
> > It’s difficult to change our opinions because they are based on many different life experiences, which makes it hard to alter an existing opinion.
>
> > We are always biased because we each experience only a subset of reality.
>
> > That is why we love stories: stories lead to conclusions.
`aka Recognized patterns.`
>
> Ex: `import this #python's opinion`

### Memory Patch
>
> We don’t have a continuous memory timeline; we have denser memory patches for recent events and sparser ones for older times.
>
>> As we get older, time seems to fly faster. Time does not actually speed up; rather we form fewer memory patches, which reduces the amount of change or learning because learning is the compression of those patches.
>
> > Perhaps this also explains why we need less sleep as we age. My theory is that sleep normalizes neuronal firing strength and frequency.

- There is no solution, only trade-off.

- Understand the mechanics by either collecting statistics or applying logic.

- You cannot connect the dots when looking forward (because the result/conjunction point has not yet occurred); you can only connect them when looking backward (after the result has happened).

- Decision fatigue

- Intelligence is an equilibrium between supply (often over-focused) and demand (often overlooked).

- Most things have a recursive property.

> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- Structure often determines the properties.

- Assuming supply is unlimited, quality versus price follows an exponential relationship, whereas quantity versus price follows a logarithmic relationship.

- We have two 'minds': the rational mind (the human cortex) and the emotional mind (the more primitive mammalian brain).

- We develop heuristics first—optimizing based on statistical bias—and later create algorithms, i.e., frameworks that explain all possible paths.

## Philosophy
>
> Philosophy is a way of evaluating internal and external actions and results—a dimension for measuring risk and reward (akin to KPIs or neural-network loss functions).
>
> > It is rare for individuals to change their philosophy because it is usually formed during early childhood.
>
> > Philosophy is guidance for action.
>
> > A new philosophy must be compatible with the existing one and its conclusions.

- Bayesian statisticians

- Everything has its mechanic.

- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.

> Most people are happy when they acquire new abilities.
>
> That’s why children are often happier than adults; they unlock new abilities far more frequently.

<hr/>

- Unconsciousness < Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you `Just different levels of trust`

> This is the reason for brands, companies, and representatives: if we solve or expand this human bottleneck—our reliance on computers—we could achieve a huge improvement.

- Your focus should be proportional to your ability to effect change.

- What you DESIRE is DIFFERENT from what you NEED.

- All evolutionary ideas challenge our assumptions.

> Ex: Einstein's E=mc^2 means energy and mass are the same thing.
> Ex: Newton established science.

> > Guide your actions with philosophy to develop consistent TRUST between others and yourself.
>
> > Principles won't have conflict with other principles `under some premises`.
>
> > IMO discrete math has many basic principles and should be taught in high school.

- Don't trust; verify.

- Discrete Math

1. Proven & Disprove theory `Proposition, Negation, Conjunction ...etc`
2. Truth Table / Logic Tree
3. Boolean Logic

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.

> Changing your path is easier than changing what you desire.
>
> Just like poker, you can't change the past; But readjusting the risk & reward model can improve future games.

## Frameworks
>
> **Frameworks** are collections of philosophy to explain reality.
> > A good framework should be able to steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
>
> > Frameworks are most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
>
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into a small number of [frameworks](experience.md#framework)
>
> > It is rare, but sometimes a new framework can lead to the development of a new philosophy.

### Trust & Habit are past artifacts of Risk & Reward

> <strong> Biological nature is about Risk & Reward Management.</strong> Habit and Trust are of the same nature, a summary of past experiences.
>> Any living thing, as it gets older, has less flexibility/change. It's because new opinions are hard to dilute due to too many past experiences.

- Connection before correction. `by Jane Nelsen`

- Life is a collection of habits.

- All interactions (communication, trade, between person, pets, countries) require **validation**. Validation, in its broadest sense, is the sum of past experiences that shape current event's expectation.
>
>> **Consensus** is common individual validation; war happens when there is no consensus on both sides.
>
>>`Consensus Stability ≈ (Breadth of Validation) × (Accuracy of Information Flow) / (Decision‑making Speed)`
>>
>>> Democracy is about increase numbers of individual validation. Pro side is Consensus are more resilient.
>>> Dictatorship just small group consensus, maybe able rapid decision, with downside consensus be unstable. Ex: Rapid changes in Chinese policy
>
>> Trust is having validation of your past. Trusting yourself requires remembering & reflecting on your past.
>
> Before you persuade others, have you been validated by others?

  <summary>Risk Reward Examples</summary>

Five parts in Risk Reward Analysis

> IMO: A common problem is people's desire for power, money, and position without assuming responsibility.
>
> > Parenting should be based on equal respect; make kids understand that more power comes with more responsibility.

- Player `Each player has its own philosophy & its own risk-reward preference`
- Action `Choices in the game; each choice has its own Risk Reward outcome`
  - A bad player is usually unaware of possible actions or stuck with the same actions.
- Turn `Opportunities that a player can choose action; Ex: stop risk/game.`
- Risk `Risk can combine together, 'gatekeeper' of reward.`
- Result `Action requires time, other causes => result. Result correlates to risk.`
- Trust `Sum of past relevant results`

> > Ex1: Great power comes great responsibility. `from spider-man`
>
> > Ex2: Cost(risk) vs Benefit(reward)
>
> > Ex3: animal reproduction
>
> > Ex4: There is no solution, only trade-off.
>
> > Ex5: A witty speaker, instead of talking directly (low risk, low reward), takes a far route (high risk, high reward).
>
> > Ex6: Most intelligent animals will PAUSE & THINK & WORRY when there is a huge reward in front of them WITHOUT EFFORT/RISK. Because intelligence has a natural instinct to measure risk & reward. A huge reward usually indicates a huge risk.

> Why do the rich get richer? It's not that the rich get richer. It's those with resources who are able to handle more risk in order to capture more reward.

> Society doesn't pay people for their hard work; we get paid for the risk we handle.

> Ex: we risk 20+ years of time for education. In a way, we risk 20+ years of being not productive, to increase productivity for the rest of our lives. We assume there is food & safety for 20+ years, and we live more than 50+ years to capture rewards.

> Often Chinese history puts the cause/effect of historical events on somebody. We should avoid that; they just play an odd game. Failure doesn't make their decision bad, and success doesn't justify their actions.

> I don't like to promote charity, karma, or deeds. Every action should be measured by risk & reward. It's rational/good to consider the reward even if the reward is NOT yours. Charity promotes selfless action. IMO we should promote ALL actions that have a positive reward, regardless of the beneficiary.
>> Ex: Education is mostly self-beneficial, yet it's most likely a positive reward for self & society. So even if education is "selfish", we should still promote it.

Poker is one of the best games about Risk & Reward. Many well-developed theories analyze risk & reward. Picking your starting hands is the most critical.

### Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decisions about what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipment to carry `RIGHT equipment > more equipment`, and which relationships to establish;
>
> During the game, your character may collect equipment `Money, Skill, Principal, Philosophy`;
>
>> IMO: Too much `equipment` will be counterproductive, just like too much junk in a hoarder's house. The right principle is determined by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
>
>> IMO: Money amplifies a person's true nature `Money is like a mushroom in Super Mario, turning you bigger`.
>
>> IMO: The hardest problem to overcome is the player control bug `mental disability`.
>
>> IMO: Lack of education & pattern recognition `Player doesn't know game rules/patterns`.
>
> Happiness comes from the player, not the character in the game; Many players don't understand themselves, or are confused between the player and the character.
>
> The only resource a player has is time.

### Society & Time
>
> Society can be compared to a rope, with the population representing its thinness and the length of time being its length. Individuals are like fibers within this rope, carrying opinions, experiences, and knowledge `aka force`. These forces `pattern/experience/knowledge` can either pass on to the next generation, or pass on to friends & families, or coworkers; Natural disasters are like external forces that suddenly hit the rope; The rope always has strands that lead to nowhere.

### Science pyramid

1. Mathematics
2. Physics
3. Chemistry
4. Biology
5. Psychology
6. Sociology

### Bio ecosystem

1. Biodiversity
2. Auto balance between hunter & prey
3. Producer -> Consumer -> xth Consumer
4. Network effect

> Tigers are very powerful, but also very limited in their living area; They must live in an area with enough food to support them; Everything has its constraints/trade-offs.

### Brain Characteristic

1. Rational (slow but accurate) vs emotion (fast but guess)
2. Parenting (cortex parenting cerebrum)
3. Connection before correction
4. Decision fatigue

### Neural network

1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs backward propagation
2. Structure determines algorithm

> I wish to be an expert in this area, as this will reveal so much about the human brain; Our main bottleneck & how to bypass it

### Difficulty w Complexity

1. There is no solution, only trade-off.
2. Decision fatigue.
3. Cause and effect are difficult to determine, but correlation is easier to detect.
4. As a system gets more complex, changes in the system require more complexity (to narrow down the exact part).

> We must make decisions because we have limited resources.
> We have limited capability to make decisions.
> There are so many decisions in complex problems/products;
>
> People use TRUST brands/representatives to simplify (abstraction) to work around complex problems;
> > In 2020 we had a lot of debate about platform immunity; the fundamental problem is product owners make decisions for users because users can't/won't/avoid making all decisions.  
>
> Engineers use correlation to guess and improve solutions.
> There isn't a scientific way to predict solutions for complex problems in the future `past results aren't proof`.
> We assume investors are willing to put their money on the line in aggregate results in good predictions.

> If complexity in a system makes changes difficult, and there is no way around it (IMO), then this explains why life has death.
> That's why I always value simplicity in systems.

### Drive to the future

1. The road is NOT always straight, with limited visibility.
2. Drivers have some control of the car.
3. Cars have momentum from past acceleration.

> Just because we are currently heading in the wrong direction, doesn't mean it's the wrong path;
>
> World-ending predictions are always wrong because they assume the future won't change, and their calculations are based on current direction and momentum;

> The most important things we can do are
> >
> > 1. Increase visibility as far as we can. `aka better prediction`
> > 2. Increase car controllability. `aka better production tech, storage tech, better response system`
> > 3. Have a backup system.

> Better not only means costing less, but being more reliable, diverse, and having less unknown impact;
> Also, that means we may not want to drive as fast as we can.

### Mathematics theory
>
> Mathematics theory (Principal) builds on top of axioms (Philosophy);
>
> Mathematicians by creativity think (Ability) + math tools (Principal & Philosophy) => develop algorithms to resolve problems (Mistakes)
>
> A formula is a condensed version of Mathematics law/theory (Principal);

- Transparency accelerates the learning process.

- If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.

- The goal is not important; the execution path is the key. The skill to navigate the path and understand the trade-offs is what makes the difference.

- Establish goals & rules in advance, and create a transparent environment.

- A better process is more valuable than a correct answer.

> Most parental mistakes root from valuing correct behavior OVER the child's psychological process.
>
> Don't go for the perfect answer. Rather focus on constant improvement of existing processes.
>
> Train kids in the risk & reward model.

- 2 approaches to solution

> Top-down approach
> > List possible causes, then start eliminating causes by logic.
>
> Bottom-up approach
> > Start from what I can do, build a module at a time, then start combining modules.

- When a leader has a strong ego, the leader's ability is the ceiling of their team.

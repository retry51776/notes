> pupil dilating ≈ mental effort

> Anchor effect exists in both System1 & System2.

> Self control uses glucose same as exercise.
>> Self control ≈ selective attention; Maybe self control is neuron increase fire frequency(explains glucose usage) to dominate unwanted impulse.

> Emotion bind fragments of memories(sensory, spatial, and temporal) together, creating a coherent narrative.

> Memories usually are facts & events, optional with event_origin, event_artefact, and sensory_memory. But facial memory are easily lost, also timestamp. Seems like memory distrusted from hippocampus to neocortex will lost timestamp info.

> Sleep is required in all animals. It takes up 30% our life time, yet we don't know how/what sleep doing. Understand sleep will have huge impact AI.
> > I assumed dreams are byproduct of brain learning(older less dreams). Maybe hippocampus distribute memory to neocortex side effect. Is there a way to increase dreams?

> Funny how AI turn out start from top instead bottom of stacks; IMO transformer model already support conscious & intelligence. It's unconscious that current AI haven't resolve. Ex vision that processed in unconscious level.

> Each cortex lob acts as a worker/node of mammal brain. Usually each cortex lob assign same function, sometime different cortex lob can switch its function(Ex: touch, sound, shape, color ...). Each lob neuron dendrites connects to other lobs related attributes. Mammal brain acts as controller, that gather all infos in cortex lobs, made a decision & send signal to rest of body.

> Consider neuron as people; people forms city, business, and other specialized district similar some neuron specialized reps some knowledge.
> > Maybe neuron communicate to create local consensus; Global working space(government) can decide 1) take majority consensus by sample then select 2) suppress majority consensus, let minority voice growth & become new consensus. (do step 1, then require focus to suppressed, the reason is hard to think)

> Brain wide info share. The winning coalition. (neurons form a group reps an object)

> How many dimension for neuron differentiate information? time, location, fire vs no fire; frequency? fire strength?

- Time: because Hebbian rule; fire together wire together; How far is range, I assumed not that far? Hebbian rule = Group operation?

CNN pool layer lost position info; Have another group op layer point to grid cells?

Maybe instead thinking Feature extraction as first step, think stabilization & fill gap with group op first.

Depth perception must be a part of object separation, but not required.

baby face hide game indicate object separation must be learn.

Single Fire direction mean information only goes one way, lost info must reattach back.

It's more like frontal lob tag extra info ON TOP visions and other sensation, NOT sensation pass info to frontal lob;

> Neuron near by has similar (not same) preference

Problem in transformer must be position encoding.

1. We don't have global attention system(even & global). Our attention effects by position, emotion, and partical.
2. There must be some kind segmentation & rejoin process in brain, which requires different position encoding.
3.

why all animals have similar emotion?

## Changes
>
> Changes is hard because complexity system need process to filter out/narrow down change.

> In a way, it's NOT changes is hard. But alternative thinking is easy.
>> Maybe improve doing always need sacrifice of thinking? Ex: baby to adult; in Brain improve function takes room, something else always have to gives.

> Change not only requires alternative neuron path(may not even exists yet), but also reroute existing signal to new neuron path.

> Analogy: There is already existing highway(habit). In order to change, you need to build alternative highway(alternative habit) which takes time. And reroute existing traffic(block traffic use highway, and force them use new road), and destroy the old highway(or let it decade).
>
>> To practice change, we always should slowly, no rush while action/decision (avoid pressure force neuron takes fastest path which it's existing path/behavior).
>
>> Repeat alternative path to strength road. Build road(neuron pathway) takes time. It's a construction project, not a decision.
>
>> What are good blockade? or good ways destroy existing path?

> I don't think minimized lost is human goal. Rather generate fastest response or something.

## Youtube Analogy
>
> Youtube server system is brain; Each Youtuber is a neuron; Youtuber(neuron) watch(input) & publish(output) videos;

> Fire together wires together;
> > Similar content videos(fires together) Youtube (brain) will recommend together(wired together);

> > Why neuron sync fire rate? I bet there is some kind "view count" signal send back to publisher(output neuron) to let it know its signal is popular. Same thing as Youtuber make similar video because they knew there is a demand for it.

> Youtuber(neuron) gets bore when no video(no input); Then youtuber(neuron) looks for other videos(new connections); Which cause youtuber changed its output videos(function);

> I think Youtube(brain) will eliminate youtuber(neuron) by view count(other neuron watch your output)

> Many popular videos get "clone"/"republish" in Youtube(brain); Similar how brain distribute computation neurons in different regions of brain.

> Youtuber(neuron) can watch one video at

## Questions

- How viewer pick which videos they watch? How to simulate in AI neuron?
- How to simulate new connection? I think we need to develop async ai model before connection problem.
- what is Zone/flow? is it some how attention is flexible?

## Common Movie design pattern

1. Shows misleading ending first, then start from beginning, then show end with a twist.
2. Try to search for some secret that is sitting in plain sight.
3. Ending with religion stuff.
4. Unchangeable destiny.
5. At first technology matters the most, but at the end relationships are most important.
6. Puzzle movie.

- More clues as the movie goes on;
- Fragmentation; Ex: Westworld season 1;

7. Tessellation; Most classic literature has tessellation; There are some side characters with few details; Yet indicates they follow the same rule & pattern that the main character follows. Ex: 红楼梦 皇帝>贾府>赖管家 (Aka recursive story)

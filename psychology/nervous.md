# Nervous System
>
> It's hard to separate hardware from application, but this note focuses more on hardware.

# Organ System

## Central Nervous System
>
> The control system that processes thought, emotion, survival, and generally provides fast response times.

- **Human Brain**
- **Mammal Brain**
- **Reptilian Brain**
- **Brain Stem** `aka Spinal Cord; breathing, heart, blood pressure, wakefulness`

## Peripheral Nervous System
>
> The control system that operates independently from the CNS but also works together with it, generally providing slower response times.

- **Somatic Nervous System** – voluntary control of skeletal muscles
- **Autonomic Nervous System** – involuntary functions
  - **Sympathetic Nervous System** `Arousing; 紧张`
    - spin core → preganglionic cell → ganglion → postganglionic cell → organ
  - **Parasympathetic Nervous System** `Calming; 放松; near organs; 12 cranial nerves`
    - Olfactory Nerve – nose; sense
    - Optic Nerve – eye; sense
    - Oculomotor Nerve – eye muscle; motor
    - Trochlear Nerve – eye muscle; motor
    - Trigeminal Nerve – jaw muscle; both
    - Abducens – eye muscle; motor
    - Facial Nerve – facial expression; both
    - Auditory Nerve – sound; sense
    - Glossopharyngeal Nerve – tongue; both
    - Vagus Nerve – heart, digestion; both
    - Spinal Accessory Nerve – head & shoulder; motor
    - Hypoglossal Nerve – speech; motor

# Organs
>
> There are three “brains.” No organ resides within the PNS.

## Human Brain
>
> Also known as the Neocortex; it consists of four lobes, association areas, and the insular cortex.
>
> The term *neocortex* comes from Greek: **neo** (new) and **cortex** (bark or rind), meaning “new bark” surrounding the older brain structures.
>
> The neocortex has six layers of neurons. Layer 1 (the outermost) contains mostly dendrites from deeper layers and very few cell bodies; layers 2‑3 work together more intensively.

> Common cortical circuit: because different cortical regions can adapt to various functions, there is a common design principle for neurons.

- **Association Areas** – link memory to sensors or processors; key for development
  - correlation
  - learning
  - thinking `reroute info to logic area`
- **Frontal Lobe** – human characteristics such as motivation, empathy, conscience
  - speaking
  - planning
  - judging
  - abstract thought
  - smell sensation
- **Parietal Lobe**
  - touch sensation `nerve input processing`
- **Occipital Lobe**
  - vision sensation `vision; associates with logic to understand concealed information`
- **Temporal Lobe** – logic, pattern, memory, location & path
  - sound perception
  - speech
  - comprehension
  - entorhinal cortex
    - Grid Cells
    - Head‑Direction (HD) cells
- **Insular Cortex**
  - taste sensation

> I like Carl Wernicke’s brain theory that each lobe processes specific aspects of objects. There is **no single place** in the brain where all meaning of an object is stored; meaning is distributed across many areas.
>
> Consciousness reflects how extensively the brain integrates different attributes. If only a few regions respond, consciousness is low.

> Attentional binding? It is selection & access.

### Frontal Lobe

- **Ventromedial PFC** – moral reasoning

## Mammal Brain
>
> Handles decision control, habit formation, long‑term memory, and emotion.
>
> Priorities: **safety** → **body language** → **perceiving emotions**

> Advantages over the cortex: faster input processing, immediate action, safety focus, and better communication.
>
> The mammal brain uses the [Peripheral Nervous System](#peripheral-nervous-system) directly to express facial expressions.

- **Pituitary Gland** – see `biology/anatomy.md#endocrine-system`
- **Basal Ganglia** – action selection
- **Hypothalamus** – regulates basic needs (sleep, sex, eating, rest) via hormones
- **Amygdala** – fight‑or‑flight; emotional processing
- **Thalamus** – relay station, amplifying sensory signals
- **Hippocampus** – converts short‑term memory into long‑term memory; reads & writes memory through pattern separation
  - Place Cells

> Emotions may be generated along three dimensions:
> - current state
> - future expectations
> - safety concerns

### Habits
>
> We are essentially a collection of habits. Habits are stored in the basal ganglia, the brain’s “kernel.” Rational decisions reside in the outer cortical layers; rationality can be viewed as a habit.
>
> **Basal Ganglia** act like an OS kernel, while the cortex functions like plug‑ins or third‑party software.
>
> Habit workflow: `Cue → Desire → (Risk & Reward Analysis, then Action) → Reward`
>
> Developing a habit: `Obsessive → Attractive → Easy → Satisfying`
>
> I realized a missing piece of the habit loop: **Risk**. Most atomic‑habit literature focuses on reward but neglects risk calculation.
>
> Inhibiting a habit: `Invisible → Disgusting → Difficult → Unsatisfied`
>
> The basal ganglia receive feedback from the cortex, enhancing or suppressing signals to the thalamus.

## Reptilian Brain
>
> (Midbrain & Hindbrain) performs basic bodily functions.
>
> **Survival Functions** – the reptilian brain drives hardware‑level responses.
>
> Default response order: Freeze → Run → Fight

- **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)** – reward feedback
- **Pons** – regulation of sleep and wakefulness
- **Medulla** – controls head and neck muscles
- **Cerebellum** – movement control

### Cerebellum
>
> Damage to the cerebellum produces a “G1 robot damped” effect on the whole body.
>
> The cerebellum contains about 80 % of the brain’s neurons and smooths output from the motor cortex.
>
> Gap junctions between inferior olivary neurons fire rapidly, enabling precise timing.

**Consciousness States**

- Awake
- Drug‑altered (`Depressants; Stimulants; Hallucinogens`)
- Hypnosis – calm, trance‑like state with heightened concentration and openness to suggestion
- Sleeping – recuperation, growth, mental function; possibly normalizes neuronal output strength

**Dopamine Producers**

- Ventral Tegmental Area
- Substantia Nigra – movement control

> [Body Language](psychology.md#body-language) is already discussed in the lobster analogy.
> Body language includes facial expressions, which are additional outputs of the mammal brain.

# Tissue
>
> I consider sub‑modules of the brain as “tissues” here.

## Basal Ganglia
>
> The basal ganglia play a critical role in action selection. They receive input from the cortex and coordinate movement execution. By filtering out irrelevant actions, they help select the most relevant ones based on learned associations and reward feedback.
>
> Action‑selection ability is observed in cats, dogs, and humans.
>
> Basal ganglia output consists of GABAergic inhibition.

- **Direct Pathway** – “go”; suppresses basal ganglia output, reducing inhibition and promoting activity
- **Indirect Pathway** – “no‑go”; enhances basal ganglia suppression, returning to baseline
- **Hyperdirect Pathway** – “stop”

> Basal ganglia components:

- Striatum – habit learning and procedural memory
- Nucleus Accumbens (NAc)
- Subthalamic Nucleus (STN)
- Globus Pallidus (GP)
- Substantia Nigra
  - Pars Compacta (SNc)
  - Pars Reticulata (SNr)

> Kravitz et al., *Nature*, 2010

> Though self‑control and willpower are related, they are distinct processes.

## Striatum
>
> Involved in habit learning and procedural memory (non‑declarative memory).

## Amygdala
>
> The “emotional brain.” It enhances memory consolidation by modulating the hippocampus (the core of declarative memory).

**Theory**
> I hypothesize that when the hippocampus distributes episodic memories to neocortical neurons, those target neurons retain neurotransmitter residues at synapses. The amygdala may release additional neuromodulators that bind only to these residues, strengthening long‑lasting connections.

>> Unlike AI, which trains on repeated data over time, animals often experience a situation once and must form strong memories quickly. Hence they need mechanisms to enhance important experiences.

## Hippocampus
>
> The hippocampus functions like an SSD cache/buffer: it retains memory temporarily and then copies it to multiple cortical locations.
>
> Functions include memory, mood regulation, stress response, pattern separation, and pattern completion.
>
> Different hippocampal subregions serve distinct purposes.

- **Surprise** increases the efficiency of memory encoding immediately.
- Memory contextual details are stored in the cortex.
- Dopaminergic connections between the VTA and hippocampus modulate memory after reward, surprise, or novelty.
- Restabilizing memories requires protein synthesis, which can take several hours (`i.e., editing memory is slow`).

### Substructures
- Dentate Gyrus – input area
- CA1 – pattern consolidation
- CA2 – social memory
- CA3 – pattern completion
- Subiculum – output area

Additional elements:
- Engrams – memory traces
- Subgranular Zone (SGZ)
- Hippocampal neurogenesis – new neurons that mature in the SGZ
- Radiology stem cells
- Pattern Completion – CA3 associates memories via strong synaptic connections; a single feature can trigger all associated features.
- Pattern Sequence – CA3 can re‑route signals back to the dentate gyrus for reprocessing (recurrent function).

> As we age, similar thoughts become conflated.

- **Pattern Separation** – ability to distinguish subtle contextual differences (`like hashing`).
  - More hippocampal neurons improve pattern separation.
  - Fewer hippocampal neurons increase susceptibility to addiction.

- **Isoxazole‑9 drug?** (research note)

## Cell

### Neuromodulators
>
> Unlike neurotransmitters, which act locally, neuromodulators affect large brain regions.

#### Extrapersonal / Long‑Range Neuromodulators
- Dopamine – desire, time perception

#### Local / “Here & Now” Neuromodulators
- Serotonin – satisfaction
- Norepinephrine – arousal or alertness (`related to endorphins`; derived from dopamine)
- Oxytocin – love (social bonding)
- Vasopressin – social attachment (“good husband hormone”)
- Acetylcholine – learning, memory, attention; muscle movement
- GABA – anxiety reduction, sleep, inhibition

### Neuron
>
> Neurons implement computation and memory functions. The details matter.

#### Components
- Neurotransmitters → receptors / gap junctions
- Dendrites
- Cell body
- Axon
- Terminals
- Synapse

#### Synapse Development & Pruning
- ~2,500 synapses per neuron at birth
- ~15,000 synapses per neuron by age 3
- ~7,000 synapses per adult neuron

### Short‑Term Memory
> Long‑term potentiation (LTP) and long‑term depression (LTD)

### Long‑Term Memory
> New dendrites and terminal structures.

## Axon Guidance
>
> The “growth cone” detects molecular cues that direct axonal growth. Receptors sense these cues, triggering local protein synthesis to steer the axon.
>
> **Attraction Cues**
- Netrin – guides axons toward general areas

**Repulsion Cues**
- Ephrin B – repels axon growth

## Axonal Plasticity
>
> Donald Hebb: “Neurons that fire together wire together; neurons that fire apart lose their connection.”

### Neuron Firing Modes
- **Burst mode** – rapid firing, strong signal but less accurate; often triggered by cues
- **Tonic mode** – regular communication

## Brain Waves
>
> Neural oscillations are rhythmic electrical patterns generated by synchronized neuronal activity.

### Frequency Bands
- Delta – deep sleep
- Theta – day‑dreaming
- Alpha – relaxation
- Beta – active thinking
- Gamma – intensive computation

> Jeff Hawkins’ theory on predictive processing.

## Glial Cells
>
> Support and maintain neurons. Glia are involved in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and synapse formation.
>
> Hypothesis: Neuronal firing triggers glial cells to increase blood supply; neurotransmitters travel with the blood to target areas, enhancing both neuronal and glial activity over time.

- Do **not** propagate action potentials (graded response)
- Ratio: ~60 billion glia to 16 billion neurons in cortex; ~16 billion glia to 69 billion neurons in cerebellum

### Types
- **Astrocytes** – ATP production, neurotransmitter removal, blood‑brain barrier support
- **Oligodendrocytes** – metabolic support, myelin sheath maintenance
- **Microglia** – immune surveillance (small white‑blood‑cell–like)
- **Ependymal cells** – produce cerebrospinal fluid; part of the glymphatic system

#### Subtypes of Ependymal Cells
- **Protoplasmic** – majority; gray matter layers 2‑6; enwraps synapses; high blood flow
- **Fibrous** – white‑matter tracts; regulates BBB
- **Interlaminar** – spans layers 1‑4
- **Varicose** – found in layers 5‑6

## Blood–Brain Barrier
>
> The BBB is a highly specialized structure separating the bloodstream from the brain and central nervous system. It is primarily formed by endothelial cells lining cerebral blood vessels.

# Questions

1. What is RNA’s role in memory formation?
2. Can RNA be introduced to enhance memory formation?
3. How does aging affect RNA processes?

## Additional Topics

- **Overall Brain Architecture**
  > I view the brain as an operating system: the reptilian brain acts like a Linux kernel, the mammal brain provides applications, and rational thought is one of many installed programs.

- **Source of Desire**
  > Dopamine circuits (future‑oriented) indicate desire, attention, planning, and time perception; other modulators (here‑and‑now) signal satisfaction, relationships, and wakefulness. We oscillate between these systems.

- **Ego / Pride**
  > Ego may be a kernel feature. Even simple organisms exhibit ego‑like behaviors.

- **Hippocampus Function**
  > The amygdala’s emotional arousal enhances hippocampal plasticity, making memories more durable.

- **Emotional Tags on Memory**
  > Memories are encoded with neuromodulatory “tags” (e.g., surprise) that affect storage efficiency.

## Study More

- Spinal‑thalamic pathways?

### Critical Phase Theory
> Neurons operate near a critical point; spikes exhibit avalanche dynamics, following power‑law distributions.

## Memory Types

- **Sensory Memory**
- **Short‑Term Memory**
- **Long‑Term Memory** – from hippocampus to neocortex
  - Declarative Memory
    - Reading
      - Emotion enhances recall (`cue sequences trigger emotion, requiring loading time`)
      - Without emotional enhancement, recall is weaker
    - Writing
      - Emotion enhances consolidation (`amygdala releases factors that boost LTP`)
  - Procedural Memory – mediated by the striatum

> **Emotions** (see `nervous.md#mammal-brain`) are optional mechanisms that enhance both reading and writing of memories, binding fragments into coherent narratives. During recall, emotion amplifies retrieval; during encoding, strong emotions increase memory strength.

### Primary Emotions (six)

- Sadness
- Disgust
- Happiness
- Surprise
- Anger
- Fear

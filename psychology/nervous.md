> It's hard to separate hardware from application, but this note focus more on hardware.

# Organ System

- Somatic Nervous System `voluntary control skeletal muscle`
- Autonomic Nervous System `involuntary`
  - Sympathetic Nervous System `Arousing;紧张;`
    - spin core -> preganglionic cell -> ganglion -> postganglionic cell -> organ

# Organ
>
> 3 brains. There is no organ within PNS.

## Human Brain
>
> aka Neocortex; 4 lobs + Association Area + Insular cortex;
> > Neocortex is latin "neo" means new and "cortex" means bark or rind. Aka new bark wrapped around tree.
>
> > Neocortex has 6 layers neurons. Layer 1(outer most) mostly dendrites of other layers, very few neurons. 2-3 layers work together.

> Common cortical circuit: `Because different cortex can adapts different functions, this indicates there is a common design neuron.`

- **Association Areas** `link memory to sensor or processor; key thing we develop in life`
  - correlation
  - learning
  - thinking `reroute info to logic area`
- **Frontal lob** `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
  - speaking
  - planning
  - judging
  - abstract
  - smell sensation
- Parietal lob
  - touch sensation `nerve input processor;`
- Occipital lob
  - vision sensation`vision; its associate logic area to understand concealed information`
- **Temporal lob** `logic; pattern; memory; location & path;`
  - sound sensation
  - speech
  - comprehension
  - entorhinal cortex
    - Grid Cell
    - Head Direction(HD) cells
- Insular cortex
  - taste sensation

> I like Carl Wernicke Brain Theory that each lob process some aspects of object. There is NO SINGLE PLACE in brain store all meaning of a object. Meaning of object are distribute in many areas of brain. There is "a hub" that these aspects of object must gather in order to process & make decision.
> > Consciousness is degrees that brain integrate different attributes. If only response by very few areas of brain, then the person is not very Consciousness.

> attentional binding? is selection & access

### Frontal lob

- Ventromedial PFC `moral`

## Mammal Brain
>
> Decision Control, habit formation, long term memory, and emotion.
>
> Mammal Brain priority: **safety** >  **body language** > **perceive emotions**

> Mammal Brain advantage over Cortex are speedy process input, immediate action, focus safety, better communication;
>
> Mammal Brain uses [Peripheral Nervous System](#peripheral-nervous-system) directly express facial expression.

- [Pituitary Gland](../biology/anatomy.md#endocrine-system)
- [**Basal Ganglia**](#basal-ganglia) `Action Selection`
- Hypothalamus `regulate basic needs through hormones: sleep, sex, eat, rest;`
- Amygdala `flight or fight; emotional brain`
- Thalamus `relay station, amplifying sensory signals`
- [**Hippocampus**](#hippocampus) `convert short term memory into long term memory; read & write memory by pattern separation;`
  - Place Cell

Maybe all emotions are generated under 3 dimensions:

- current
- future
- safety

### Habits
>
> We are just a collection of habits. Habits are store in basal ganglia, center of brain. Rational decision are in outer layer of brain. In a way be rational is a habit.
>
> Basal ganglia is almost like kernel of OS. The rational part (cortex) is more a plugin/3rd party software of OS.
>
> Habit Workflow: `Cue > Desire > (Risk & Reward Analysis, then Action) > Reward`
>
> Develop Habit: `Obsessive > Attractive > Easy > Satisfy`
> > I just realize missing piece of Habit Loop: Risk; Most of Atomic Habit focus on Reward, but not consider adjust Risk calculation;
>
> Inhibit Habit: `Invisible > Disgusting > Difficult > Unsatisfied`
> > Basel ganglia brain listen feedback from cortex, enhance & suppress signal to thalamus;

## Reptilian brain
>
> (Mid Brain & Hind Brain) perform basic body functions
>
> Survival Stuff; Reptilian brain acts as driver for hardware.

> Default Response order: Freeze > Run > Fight

- Ventral Tegmental Area(VTA) `reward feedback`
- Pons `regulation of sleep and wakefulness`
- Medulla `control the muscles of the head and neck`
- Cerebellum `Movement Control`

Consciousness state:

- Awake
- Drug Alter `Depressant; Stimulants; Hallucinogens`
- Hypnosis `calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have **heightened concentration and focus**, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion.`
- Sleeping `recuperation; growth; mental function;`

dopamine producer:

- Ventral Tegmental Area
- Substantia Nigra `movement`

> [Body Language](psychology.md#body-language) is already shown in lobster.
> > Body Language includes Facial language. which it's additional output from Mammal Brain.

# Tissue
>
> I consider sub modules of brain are tissue here.

## Basal ganglia
>
> Basal ganglia critical role in action selection. They receive input from the cortex and are involved in the coordination and execution of movements. The basal ganglia help in filtering out irrelevant actions and selecting the most relevant ones based on learned associations and reward feedback.

> Action selection ability shows in cat, dogs, & human.

> Basal ganglia output are GABA supress signal.

- Direct Pathway `aka go; suppress basal ganglia's output, stop suppress right signal; This does NOT effect your decision. Rather make you more active/energetic on your decision.`
- Indirect Pathway `aka no go; increase basal ganalia's suppression; Return to normal dependence on return normal from Indirect Pathway.`
- Hyperdirect `aka stop.`

> Basal ganglia components:

- Striatum `habit learning and procedural memory`
- Nucleus Accumbens(NAc)
- Subthalamic nucleus (STN)
- Globus Pallidus (GP)
- Substantia nigra
  - Pars Compacta (SNc)
  - Pars Reticulata (SNr)

> Kravtiz et al; Natrue, 2010

> Though & Self Control is 2 different things.

## Striatum

habit learning and procedural memory(aka non-declarative memory).

## Amygdala

"emotional brain," optional(use emotion) enhances memory consolidation by modulating the hippocampus(the core of declarative memory).

**Theory**
> My guess is when Hippocampus distribute episode memory(write process) to neocortex neurons; fired/target neocortex neurons will have neurotransmitter artifacts between synapse. Maybe Amygdala release other neurotransmitters to neocortex ONLY binds with these artifacts, which created strong/forever synapse connections?

>> Why? Unlike AI can train from repeat training data(slowly eat food). Animals only experienced situation once(gobble down whole food). Therefor animals need enhance important experiences.

## Hippocampus
>
> Hippocampus seems like cache/buffer of SSD. It does retain memory, then clone memory multiple places in cortex.

> Memory, Mood, Stress, Pattern Separation & Pattern Completion;

> Different location hippocampus neurons have different application.

> Surprise will increase write memory effeteness immediately.
>
> memory contextual details stores in cortex.
>
> Depaminergic connections between the Ventral Tegmental Area(VTA) and hippocampus can modulate memory after reward, suprise, or novelty.

> Restabilize memory requires protein synthesis, which can take several hours. `aka edit memory is slow`

- Dentate gyrus `input area`
- CA1 `pattern consolidation`
- CA2 `social memory`
- CA3 `pattern completion`
- Subiculum `output area`

- engrams `memory traces`
- Subgranular Zone (SGZ)
- hippocampal neurons; neurons that growth in SGZ.

- radiology stem cells
- neurogenesis `new neuron that grow into mature neurons`
- Pattern Completion `CA3: associate memory develop by strength feature neuron synataxs; Later single feature will cause all associated features fired;`
- Pattern Sequence `CA3 can rewire signal back to dentate gyrus to reprocess; aka recurrent function to chain events.`

> As we age, we think similar things are same.

- Pattern Separation `able to pick up more attributes from context. aka hash features.`

> More hippocampal neurons will have better pattern separation.

> Less hippocampal neurons will easier to addict to drugs.

> Isoxazole-9 drug?

> Attention? Which organs?
> Attentional Blink(AB) is multiple stimuli is one after another will fight for limited attentional resource;(500ms)

# Cell

## Neuromodulator
>
> Unlike neurotransmitters communcation locally, neuromodulator effect large section of brain at once.

Extrapersonal/Far Neuromodulator

- Dopamine `Desire, time perception`

Here & Now Neuromodulator

- Serotonin `full or satisfaction`
- Norepinephrine `arousal or alertness; aka endorphins; make from Dopamine;`
- Oxytocin `love female`
- Vasopressin `good husband hormone`
- Acetylcholine `learning, memory, attention; muscle movement`
- GABA `anxiety, sleep, inhibitor`

## Neuron

> We know computation & memory functions are implemented by Neuron. But devil is in the detail.

Neuron Cell

- neurotransmitters > recepitor / gap junctions
- Dendrites
- Cell Body
- Axon
- Terminals
- Synapse

Synapse Development & Prune

- 2500 Synapse/per neuron when born;
- 15000 Synapse/per neuron when 3 years old;
- 7000 Synapse/per neuron when adult;

> New Dendrites & Terminals Structure.

synaptic specificity?
Path integration?

new neurons in brain

- Dentate Gyrus
- Subventricular Zone
- Striatum

### Axon Guidance
>
> "Growth cone" has receptor detects near by "molecular cues", molecular cues attracts more mRNA is direction, which produces more protiens to steer axon growth path.
>
> Effectness of cue by measure degrees anagle it changes axon.

> Local Translation: `Growth Cone can uses mRNA to produce protiens locally without cell body(for a period).`

Attraction Cues:

- netrin `guidance protein only guide to general area, not to target cell.`

Repulsion Cues:

- EphrinB `repel axon growth`

mRNA
mTOR `protein steer axon`

958 mRNAs in growth cone

growing: axon elongation guidance

wiring: Branching, Pruning, Synaptogenesis

Mature:
synaptic transmission?
axon survival?

### Axonal plasticity
>
> Donald Hebb `Neuron fire together wired together, fire apart wired apart`

> If down stream neuron just fired before(20ms) upstream neuron, then upstream signal mostly lost due to lack of recepator.

Neuron switch transmitter under stress

burst mode `rapid neuron fires, strong signal but not accurate; usually trigger by cue`
tonic mode `normal neuron communication`

### Brain Waves
>
> Neural oscillations, are rhythmic patterns of electrical activity generated by the brain. These electrical signals are produced by the collective behavior of billions of neurons firing in synchrony.

Frequency & Amplitude

- Delta Wave `deep sleep`
- Theta Wave `day dream`
- Alpha Wave `relax`
- Beta Wave `thinking`
- Gamma Wave `hardcore calculation`

> Jeff Hawkins

## Glial
>
> Supporting and maintaining neurons. Glial cell most likely a part brain function in a complex way.

> Glial are involved in processes such as neurogenesis (generation of new neurons), neuronal migration, and synapse formation.

> Guess: Neuron fires trigger its Glial Cell increase blood supply, then neurotransmitters in blood supply flowed into target cell area, interact with target neurons & glial cell to increase blood supply long term(aka confirm process), then because long term increase blood supply, target neurons get bigger.

> can NOT progagate Action Potentials
> graded response

> 60 billion glia to 16 billion neurons within the cortex, but only 16 billion glia to 69 billion neurons in the cerebellum.
>
- Glial Cell Tumors `most common brain Tumors`

other Glial Cell functions:

> Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) a highly specialized structure that separates the bloodstream from the brain and central nervous system (CNS). It is primarily formed by the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in the brain.

# Questions

1. How is RNA's role in memory formation?
2. Is there a way to inject RNA to help memory formation?
3. How's aging effect RNA process?

- What/How is Brain Process overall architecture?
  > I think brain is very much like OS, reptile brain acts as linux kernel, and mammal brain acts as applications installed in OS. Rational just one of many installed software.

- Where desire comes from?

 > We have dopamine (future)circuit to indicates desire, attention, plan, time perception; Also have other modulator (Here & Now)circuit to indicate statfacation, relationship, awake; We are seesaw between these 2 circuits;

- What is ego/pride?
  > Ego/pride most likely a kernel feature. Even lobster, animals existed before human have ego.

- How Hippocampus works? Maybe is help AI development.

> amygdala emotional arousal increases neural plasticity in the hippocampus, making memories more durable

- Is all memory have 6 emotional tags?
  > Memory is encoded into neuron synapse (structure & connection) `Environment Activity -> Neural Activity -> microRNA -> neuron synapse changes -> changes to Neural Activity` Surprise increase efficient write memory.

# Nervous System
> It's hard to seperate hardware from application, but this note focus more on hardware.

> Programming Analogy

> Cell > Tissue > Organ > Organ System > Organism

# Organ System
> I think so far there are only 2 nervous system we awares.

## Central Nervous System
> Control system that process thought, emotion, survial, generatly fast response time.
- [**Human Brain**](#human-brain)
- [**Mammal Brain**](#mammal-brain)
- [**Reptilian Brain**](#reptilian-brain)
- Brain Stem `aka Spinal Cord; breathing, heart, blood pressure, wakefulness;`

## Peripheral Nervous System
> Control system independently from CNS, but also operate together, generatly slower response time.

- Somatic Nervous System `voluntary control skeletal muscle`
- Autonomic Nervous System `involuntary`
  - Sympathetic Nervous System `Arousing;紧张;`
    - spin core -> preganglionic cell -> ganglion -> postganglionic cell -> organ
  - Parasympathetic Nervous System `Calming;放松;near organ;12 cranial nerves`
    - Olefactory Nerve `nose; sense`
    - Optic Nerve `eye; sense`
    - Oculomotor Nerve `eye muscle; motor`
    - Trochlear Nerve `eye muscle; motor`
    - Trigeminal Nerve `jaw muscle; both`
    - Abducens `eye muscle; motor`
    - Facial Nerve `facial expression; both`
    - Auditory Nerve `sound; sense`
    - Glossopharyngeal Nerve `tongue; both`
    - Vagus Nerve `heart, digest; both`
    - Spinal Accessory Nerve `head & shoulder; motor`
    - Hypoglossal Nerve `talk; motor`


# Orgin
> 3 brains. I need to research more orgin for PNS.

## Human Brain
> aka Neocortex; 4 lobs + Association Area + Insular cortex;
> > Neocortex is latin "neo" means new and "cortext" means bark or rind. Aka new bark wraped around tree.
> 
> > Neocortex has 6 layers neurons. Layer 1(outter most) mostly dendrites of other layers, very few neorons. 2-3 layers work together.

> Common cortical circuit: `Because different cortex can adpat different functions, this indicates there is a common design neuron.`
- **Association Areas** `link memory to sensor or processor; key thing we develop in life`
  - correlation
  - learning
  - thinking `reroute info to logic area`
- **Frontal lob** `human characteristic; Ex: motivation, empathy, conscience`
  - speaking
  - planning
  - judging
  - abstract
  - smell sensation
- Parietal lob
  - touch sensation `nerve input processor;`
- Occipital lob
  - vision sensation`vision; its associate logic area to understand concealed information`
- **Temporal lob** `logic; pattern; memory;`
  - sound sensation
  - speech
  - comprehension
- Insular cortex
  - taste sensation

## Mammal Brain
> aka Mid Brain; Decision Control, habbit formation, long term memory, and emotion.
>
> Mammal Brain workflow: **safety** >  **body language** > **perceive emotions**
> 
> Default Response order: Freeze > Run > Fight

> Mammal Brain advantage over Cortex are speedy process input, immediate action, focus safety, better communication;

- [Pituitary Gland](../biology/anatomy.md#endocrine-system)
- [Basal Ganglia](#basal-ganglia) `Action Selection`
- Hypothalamus `regulate basic needs through hormones: sleep, sex, eat, rest;`
- Amygdala `flight or fight`
- Thalamus `relay station`
- Hippocampus `convert short term memory into long term memory; Only create memory;`

>
> Mammal Brain uses [Peripheral Nervous System](./../biology/anatomy.md#peripheral-nervous-system-pns) directly express body language.
> 
All mammals have 6 Primary Emotions
- Sad
- Disgust
- Happy
- Surprise
- Anger
- Fear.

> > Basel gangalia brain listen feedback from cortex, enhace & supress signal to thalamus;
> 
> > We should use [Parenting model](parent.md) to train mammal brain.
> > Connection before correction.


## Reptilian brain
> aka Hind Brain; basic body functions
>
> Survival Stuff; I think of Reptilian brain as driver for hardware.

- Pons `regulation of sleep and wakefulness`
- Medulla `control the muscles of the head and neck`
- Cerebellum `Movement Control`

Consciousness state:
- Awake
- Drug Alter `Depressant; Stimulants; Hallucinogens`
- Hypnosis `calm, trance-like state during which you tend to have **heightened concentration and focus**, and in which you're typically more open to suggestion.`
- Sleeping `recuperation; growth; mental function;`

# Tissue
> I consider sub modules of brain are tissue here.

## Basal ganglia
> Basal ganglia critical role in action selection. They receive input from the cortex and are involved in the coordination and execution of movements. The basal ganglia help in filtering out irrelevant actions and selecting the most relevant ones based on learned associations and reward feedback.

> Action selection ability shows in cat, dogs, & human. Of course means basal ganglia is part of mammal brain(mid brain)

> Basal ganglia output are GABA supress signal.
- Direct Pathway `supress basal ganglia's output, aka stop supress right signal; This does NOT effect your decision. Rather make you more active/energetic on your decision.`
- Indirect Pathway `increase basal ganalia's supression; Return to normal dependences on return normal from Indirect Pathway.`

> Though & Self Control is 2 different things.

# Cell

## Neuron
> We know computation & memory functions are implemented by Neuron. But devil is in the detail.

Neuron Cell
- neurotransmitters > recepitor / gap junctions
- Dendrites
- Cell Body
- Axon
- Terminals
- Synapse


## Axon Guidance
> "Growth cone" has receptor detects near by "molecular cues", molecular cues attracts more mRNA is direction, which produces more protiens to steer axon growth path.
>
> Effectness of cue by measure degrees anagle it changes axon.

> Local Translation: `Growth Cone can uses mRNA to produce protiens locally without cell body(for a period).`

Attraction Cues:
- netrin `guidance protein only guide to general area, not to target cell.`

Repulsion Cues:
- EphrinB `repel axon growth`

mRNA
mTOR `protein steer axon`

958 mRNAs in growth cone

growing: axon elongation guidance

wiring: Branching, Pruning, Synaptogenesis

Mature:
synaptic transmission?
axon survival?

## Axonal plasticity
> Donald Hebb `Neuron fire together wired together, fire apart wired apart`

> If down stream neuron just fired before(20ms) upstream neuron, then upstream signal mostly lost due to lack of recepator.

Neuron switch transmitter under stress

burst mode `rapid neuron fires, strong signal but not accurate; usually trigger by cue`
tonic mode `normal neuron communcation`

# Questions:

1. How is RNA's role in memory formation?
2. Is there a way to inject RNA to help memory formation?
3. How's aging effect RNA process?
4. Which neurotransmitters that cause desire,  which neurotransmitters cause satisfaction?
5. Which ways causes neuro cell growth or die out its synax? I assumed feedback system is carry by neurotransmitters, or other chemical compound.
6. How axonal sprouting works?
7. Guidance protein for axon?


- What/How is Brain Process overall architecture?
  > I think brain is very much like OS, reptile brain acts as linux kernal, and mammal brain acts as applications installed in OS. Rational just one of many installed software.

- Where desire comes from?

- What is ego/pride?
  > Ego/pride most likely a kernal feture. Even loster, animals existed before human have ego.

- How Hippocampus works? Maybe is help AI development.

- Is all memory have 6 emotional tags?
  > Memory is encoded into neuron synapse (structure & connection) ` Envirenment Activity -> Neural Activity -> microRNA -> neuron synapse changes -> changes to Neural Activity`

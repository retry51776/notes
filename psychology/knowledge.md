# Personal Value
> It is recommended that you prioritize your top 10 personal values and strive to live by them.
> 
> By living in accordance with your values, you may find that you feel happier, have more confidence in your decisions, and have a clearer direction in your life.

Ex Personal Values from google:
- Personal growth
- Dependability
- Adaptability
- Well-being
- Altruism
- Compassion
- Integrity
- Generosity
- Courage
- Gratitude
- Sustainability
- Frugality
- Loyalty
- Family
- Humility
- Assertiveness
- Uniqueness
- Sustainability


# Conclusion
`aka Recognized patterns.`

- All knowledge build on top assumptions, aware assumption can be invalidated.

- Everything has its mechanic.
> Understand **mechanic** by either collect statistics, or by logic;

- There is no solution, only tradeoff.

- Great power comes great responsibility. `from spider-man`
> IMO: Common problem is people's desire for power, money, and position without assuming responsibility.
> 
> > Parenting should base on equal respect; Make kid understand more power comes with more responsibility.

- Most things have recursive property.
> Ex: Wealth, Knowledge, Ability, Social Skill

- Heard < Seen < Used < Understand < Improve < Trust yourself < Others trust you
> or knowing < remembering < understanding < communicating

- Intelligence is equilibrium of supply `often too much focus` and demand `often overlook`.

- Decision fatigue
> The reason for Brand, Company, Representative; If we solved/expand this humanity BOTTLENECK`reliance on computer?`, we will make great improvement.

- Often structure determent properties.

- All evolutionary ideas are breaking our assumptions.
> Ex: Einstein E=mc^2 means energy and mass is same thing.
> Ex: Newton establish science.

  - Classic Physic
    - CSI
  - The Standard Model
  - Theoretical physics

# Principal
`aka belief/guidance/assumption.`

- Discrete math
1. Proven & Disprove theory `Proposition, Negation, Conjunction ...etc`
2. Truth Table / Logic Tree
3. Boolean Logic

`Self principals:`
- Transparency accelerate learning process.
> The very reason I write this repo.

- Focus proportional to YOUR ability to change it.
> Connection before correction. `by Jane Nelsen`
- Don't trust, verify.
- Seek satisfaction, not happiness.
> Most people happy when they have new ability.
> 
> That's why kid way happier than adult, kid unlock new ability more frequents than adult.

- Past can't change; Only reflect if you intended change yourself for future.
> Change your path is easier than change what your desire.

- Repetition training is most effective way to change. `Not talking about memory, just habits.`

- We have two minds, the rational mind `human brain/cortex`, and the emotional mind `mammal brain`.
> Mammal brain express through body language, has 6 primary emotions.
> 
> Rational mind just pattern recognition machine.
>
> People communication often neglected emotional mind`both self & other`. 
> 
> We reverted to reptilian brain in time of conflict.
> > Hack around by delay response. `aka cool off period`

- Pain + Reflection = Progress

- We develop heuristics first, `optimize based of statistical bias`, then algorithms `framework explain all possible paths`;

`Team work principals:`
- If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.

- Goal is not important, execution path is the key. The skill to navigate in path and understand the tradeoffs is what makes different.

- Establish goal & rule in advanced, and transparent environment.

- Better workflow is more valuable than correct answer.
> Most parent mistakes root from parent value correct behavior OVER child's psychology workflow.
>
> Don't go for perfect answer. Rather focus on constance improvement of existing workflow.


- 2 approaches to solution
> Top down approach
> > List possible causes, then start eliminate causes by logic.
> 
> Bottom up approach
> > Start from what I can do, build a module at a time, then start combine module.

- When leader w strong ego, leader's ability is ceiling of their team.


# Framework
> Some well know framework/relationship that can apply in different areas;

## Life Framework
> Life is a video game

> You `player` have to make decision what you want to collect `or not collect`, where you explore, which equipments to carry `RIGHT equipments > more equipments`, which relationships to establish;
> 
> During the game, your character may collect equipments `Money, Skill, Principal, Value`;
> 
>> IMO: Too many `equipments` will be counter productive, just like too many junks in hoarder house. Right principle is determent by your **PROBLEM** `game`.
> 
>> IMO: Money amplify person true nature `Money is like mushroom in super mario, turn you bigger`.
> 
>> IMO: Hardest problem to overcome is player control bug `mental disability`.
> 
>> IMO: Lack of education & recognize pattern `Player don't know game rule/pattern`.
> 
> Happiness comes from player, not character in game; Many player don't understand player himself, or confused between player and character.
>
> The only resource player have is time.


## Science pyramid
1. Mathematics
2. Physics
3. Chemistry
4. Biology
5. Psychology
6. Sociology

## Bio ecosystem
1. Bio diversity
2. Auto balance between hunter & pray
3. Producer -> Consumer -> xth Consumer
4. Network effect

> Tiger is very powerful, but also very limited in their living area; They must live in area w enough food support them; Everything has its constrain/tradeoff.

## Human brain & relationship
1. logic(slow but accurate) vs emotion(fast but guess)
2. parenting(cortex parenting cerebrum)
3. Connection before correction
4. Decision fatigue

## Neural network
1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs backward propagation
2. Structure determent algorithm
> I wish to be expert in this area, this will reveal so much about human brain; Our main bottleneck & how to bypass them

## Difficulty w Complexity
1. There is no solution, only tradeoff.
2. Decision fatigue.
3. Cause and effect are difficulty to determent, but correlation is easier to detect.
> We must make decision because we can't have everything.
> We have limited capability to make decision.
> There are so many decisions in complex problem/product;
> 
> People uses trust`brand, representatives` and simplify`abstraction, metaphor, framework` to work around complex problem;
> > In 2020 we have a lot debate about platform immunity; fundamentally problem is product owner makes decisions for user because user can't/won't/avoid make all decision.  
> 
> Engineer uses correlation to guess, improve solution.
> There isn't a scientific way to predict solution for complex problem in future`past result isn't prove`.
> We assume investor willing to put their money on the line in aggregate result in good prediction.

## Drive to the future
1. The road is NOT always straight, with limited visibility.
2. Driver have some control of car.
3. Car have momentum from past acceleration.

> Just because we currently heading in wrong direction, doesn't mean it's wrong path;
>
> World ending predictions always wrong because they assume future won't change, and their calculation based on current direction and momentum;

> The most important thing we can do are
> > 1. Increase visibility as far as we can. `aka better prediction`
> > 2. Increase car controllability. `aka better production tech, storage tech, better resp system`
> > 3. Have a backup system.

> Better not only mean cost less, but more reliable, diverse, less unknown impact;
> Also that means we may not want to drive as fast as we can.

## Mathematics theory
> Mathematics theory(Principal) build on top of axioms(Value);
>
> Mathematician by creativity think(Ability) + math tools(Principal & Value) => develop algorithm(Skill) to resolve problem(Mistake)
>
> Formula(Skill) is condensed version of Mathematics law/theory(Principal);

## Common Movie design pattern
1. Shows misleading ending first, then start from beginning, then show end with a twist.
2. Try to search for some secret that is sitting in plain sight.
3. Ending with religion stuff.
4. Unchangeable destiny.
5. At first technology matter the most, but at the end relationship are most important.
6. Puzzle movie.
7. Tessellation; Most classic literary have tessellation; There are some side characters with few details; Yet indicates they follow same rule & pattern that main character follow. Ex: 红楼梦 皇帝>贾府>赖管家

# Workflow
> Just write down my understand of psychological process;
>
> I divides brain into human brain `rational` and [mammal brain](psychology.md#mammal-brain) `emotional`;
> 
> I only focus on [Central Nervous System Workflow](./../biology/anatomy.md#central-nervous-system-cns) `aka rational`, is based on [**Psychology**](./psychology.md)
>
> Inspired by Ray Dalio's Principal and Positive discipline by Jane Nelsen.
> > IMO: Both book have same idea, develop & enforce workflow.

## Forward Propagation Workflow
aka decision process

> [Desire](#desire) > Problem > [**Awareness**](#awareness) > [**Association**](./psychology.md#4-association) > [**Action**](#reflection-process)


## Backward Propagation Workflow
aka [reflection process](#reflection-process)
> Result > [Evaluation](#reflection-process) > [Diagnosis](#diagnose) > [Design](#design) > [Implementation](#implementation)

[**Desire**](#desire), [**Awareness**](#awareness), [**Knowledge**](#knowledge) are key elements to control workflow `aka behavior`.

# Definitions


## Desire
> There is a natural psychological desire within us to **belong** and have **power**.
>
> Remember power comes with responsibility, ask your self when you desire something, are you ready for responsibility.
>
> It is difficult to change desires, so it is easier to simply avoid the things that trigger desire.


## Awareness
> Awareness can break down to [**Attention**](./psychology.md#1-attention) > [Sensation](./psychology.md#2-sensation) > [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception)
>
> If you lack of some awareness, most likely your personal value doesn't prioritize it.

## Knowledge
> [Knowledge](knowledge.md) is accumulate state `RNN hidden state` of CNS Workflow;
> 
> I categorizes Knowledge into Natural & Acquired.

Natural Knowledge:
### Memory & Emotion
> [**Memory & Emotion**](./psychology.md#emotion--memory-association) includes Working Memory & Long Term Memory & Emotion.

### Conclusion
> [**Conclusion**](knowledge.md#conclusion) is recognized pattern derived from past observation.
> > It's difficult to change our conclusion because it's based on many different results, which makes it hard to dilute the existing conclusion.
>
> > We are always be `bias` because we all only experiences subset of realities.
> 
> > Conclusion is guidance for action.
>
> > The very reason we love story, story lead to conclusion.

### Personal Value
> [**Personal Value**](knowledge.md#personal-value) are ways we evaluate the internal & external action & result.`aka KPI for evaluation; Or NN Loss Functions;`
> > It is rare for individuals to change their personal values because these values are typically developed during early childhood.
> 
> > The new personal value require compatibility with existing personal value & conclusion.

Acquired Knowledge:
### Skill
> **Skills** are learned [**Actions**](#reflection-process);
> > Procedural Memory. Most people able obtain.
>
### Principal
> [**Principals**](knowledge.md#principal) are [**core conclusions**](#conclusion) support/explain [other conclusions](knowledge.md#conclusion);
> > Metaphor: algorithms transform unknown equation into solvable equation
> 
> > Principal won't have conflict w other principals `under some premises`.
> 
> > IMO discrete math has many basic Principal, should be taught in HS.

### Frameworks
> [**Frameworks**](#framework) are collection of principals & conclusions to explain reality. `aka mental construction of reality.`
> > A good framework should able steelman argue `or explain` for every subject's action `aka people's POV`;
> 
> > Framework most likely in 2 types: Top-down VS Bottom-Up
> 
> > IMO: Most things in life can fit into small number of [frameworks](knowledge.md#framework)
> 
> > It is rare, but sometime new framework to lead to the development of new personal values.


# Reflection Process
> [Reflection Process](#backward-propagation-workflow) is backward propagation workflow. 
## Evaluation #1: Do nothing.
  - 1.1 Don't recognized problem.
  - 1.2 Ignore problem.


## Evaluation #2: Avoid problem.
  - 2.1 Change path
  - 2.2 Change desires


## Evaluation #3: Self improvement.
  ### Diagnose
  - 3.1 Diagnose `listen other; reexamine knowledge`
    - 3.1.2 [Desire](#desire) `Belong or Power?`
      - Increase:
        - reprioritize personal value;
        - convert emotion to motivation
      - Decrease:
        - [avoid](#evaluation-2-avoid-problem)
        - power comes w responsibility
    - 3.1.2 [Awareness](#awareness)
      - [attention?](psychology.md#1-attention)
        - reprioritize personal value;
        - improve workflow design;
        - more workflow training;
      - [sensation?](psychology.md#2-sensation)
        - any work around? `i can't fix blind`
      - [perception?](./psychology.md#3-perception)
        - biology perception? `work around?`
        - psychology perception? [`study emotion & mammal brain, and PNS`](../biology/anatomy.md)
          - internal
          - external
    - 3.1.3 [Association](psychology.md#4-association)
      - Add Knowledge `missing skill; establish association;Dilution;`
      - Avoid Association
      - Edit Association `Reedit memory; divide & conquer;`
  - 3.2 Validate diagnose
    - 3.2.1 start from problem
      - can you reproduce problem?
      - list out possible cause, then elimination
    - 3.2.2 start from ability
      - can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
      - can you limited variables?
      - can you execute potential solution see result?
  ### Design
  - 3.3 Communication
    - 3.3.1 Connection before correction.
      - External: confirm their feeling, share your feeling
      - Internal: trust yourself, aka [mammal brain](psychology.md#mammal-brain)
  - 3.4 Design workflow
    - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember compromise
    - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement
  ### Implementation
  - 3.5 Training
    - 3.5.1 confirm improvement
    - 3.5.2 repeatation is the key
  - 3.6 Conclusion
    - 3.6.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson
    - 3.6.2 explore alternative
    - 3.6.3 document [adjustment of knowledge](#knowledge)
      - Ex: skill, conclusion, principal, personal value
    - 3.6.4 develop trust `internal & external`


## Evaluation #4: Outsource Problem.
  - 4.1 Reliance on people
  - 4.2 Reliance on machine

# Learning Process

> Just like a computer, our brain has biology (hardware) & psychology (software).  
> Inspired by Ray Dalio's *Principles* and *Positive Discipline* by Jane Nelsen.

> Life is like compression algorithms: compress sensation to form reaction, from reaction develop habit, from habit to instincts, from instincts to knowledge.

## Biology

> I categorize the [brain](nervous.md#brain) into two parts:
> - [Rational human brain](nervous.md#human-brain)
> - [Emotional mammal brain](nervous.md#mammal-brain)

## Psychology

### Forward Propagation Process

> **Awareness** → Desire → **Action** → **Reward**

> We have many forward‑propagation processes compared to backward‑propagation processes.

### Backward Propagation Process

> Result → **Action** → Diagnosis → Design → Implementation  
> The reason we need practice is that the brain doesn't have neural‑network backward propagation; learning involves neurons synchronizing fire timing to strengthen synaptic connections. The basic form of learning is association. Once a bad habit is formed, it is very hard to change.

**Awareness** and **Action** are important factors that influence the decision process.  
**Desire** and **Reward** are less under our control.

> Most of the time, the brain takes in *current input* to decide **current action**;  
> we often forget to consider *past input* (history) to predict past actions, then evaluate against historical records. The greatest benefit of studying history is having more data and cheaper evaluation.

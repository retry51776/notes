# Learning Process
> Just like computer, our brain have biology(hardware) & psychology(software).
> 
> Inspired by Ray Dalio's Principal and Positive discipline by Jane Nelsen.

## Biology
> I categorize the [brain](nervous.md#brain) into two parts:
> > [Rational human brain](nervous.md#human-brain);
> >
> > [Emotional mammal brain](nervous.md#mammal-brain);


## Psychology
### Forward Propagation Process

> [**Awareness**](#awareness) > [Desire](#desire) > [**Action**](#action) > [**Reward**](#reward)


### Backward Propagation Process
> Result > [**Action**](#action) > [Diagnosis](#diagnose) > [Design](#design) > [Implementation](#implementation)

[**Awareness**](#awareness), [**Action**](#action) are important factors that influence decision process.

[Desire](#desire), [Reward](#reward) are less in our control.


> Most the time brain take in CURRENT INPUT to decide [**CURRENT ACTION**](#action);
> 
> We often forgot to take PAST INPUT(**history**) to predict [**past action**](#action); Then evaluate against historical record. The greatest benefit of study history is have more data & cheaper evaluation.

> Logic Formulary
> 
> Current + Action = Desire
>
> Desire - Current = Action
> 
> Desire - Action = Current

# Psychology Definitions

## Awareness
> Awareness can break down to [**Attention**](./psychology.md#1-attention) > [Sensation](./psychology.md#2-sensation) > [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception)
>
> If you lack of some awareness, most likely your personal value doesn't prioritize it.
> > Prioritize [personal value](#personal-value), then learn [skills](#skill) to improve [Perception](psychology.md#3-perception);

### Cue
> Any [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception) that trigger habit loop.


## Desire
> There is a natural psychological desire within us to **belong** and have **power**.
>
> Dopamine ≈ desires; 80% neuronal cell have receptors to dopamine.
>
> Man can do what he desire, but can't will his desire; It's easier to simply avoid the CUE that trigger desire.
>
> > Remember power comes with responsibility, ask your self when you desire something, are you ready for responsibility.

## Reward
> Reward or satisfaction is DIFFERENT than desire.
>
> Serotonin ≈ happy & satisfaction.
>
> Raphe nuclei are clusters of neurons located in the brainstem that are the primary source of serotonin projections to the rest of the brain.

# Action
- 1 [Risk & Reward Analysis](experience.md#risk-reward)
  - [From Past Experience](#experience)
  - From Logic Deduction
- 2 Choice 1 of 4 Actions
  - a: Do nothing.
    - a.1 Don't recognized problem.
    - a.2 Ignore problem.
  - b: Avoid problem.
    - b.1 Change path
    - b.2 Change desires
  - c: [Self improvement](#self-improvement).
  - d: Outsource Problem.
    - d.1 Reliance on people
    - d.2 Reliance on machine

## Experience
> [Experiences](experience.md) are accumulate state `RNN hidden state` of CNS Process;
> > There is no such thing as believer, nor non-believer; Just many past experience moves you from 0.01% non-believer to 99.99% believer.

## Self improvement.
  ### Diagnose
  - 3.1 Diagnose `listen other; reexamine experience`
    - 3.1.2 [Desire](#desire) `Belong or Power?`
      - Increase:
        - re-prioritize personal value;
        - convert emotion to motivation
      - Decrease:
        - [avoid](#evaluation-2-avoid-problem)
        - power comes w responsibility
    - 3.1.2 [Awareness](#awareness)
      - [attention?](psychology.md#1-attention)
        - re-prioritize personal value;
        - improve process design;
        - more process training;
      - [sensation?](psychology.md#2-sensation)
        - any work around? `i can't fix blind`
      - [perception?](./psychology.md#3-perception)
        - biology perception? `work around?`
        - psychology perception? [`study mammal brain`](psychology.md#3-perception)
          - internal
          - external
    - 3.1.3 [Experience](psychology.md#4-experience)
      - Add Experience
      - Avoid Trigger
      - Edit Association
  - 3.2 Validate diagnose
    - 3.2.1 start from problem
      - can you reproduce problem?
      - list out possible cause, then elimination
    - 3.2.2 start from ability
      - can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
      - can you limited variables?
      - can you execute potential solution see result?
  ### Design
  - 3.3 Communication
    - 3.3.1 Connection before correction.
      - External: confirm their feeling, share your feeling
      - Internal: trust yourself, aka [mammal brain](nervous.md#mammal-brain)
  - 3.4 Design Process
    - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember compromise
    - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement
  ### Implementation
  - 3.5 Training
    - 3.5.1 confirm improvement
    - 3.5.2 repetition is the key
  - 3.6 Conclusion
    - 3.6.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson
    - 3.6.2 explore alternative
    - 3.6.3 document [adjustment of experience](#experience)
      - Ex: skill, conclusion, principal, personal value
    - 3.6.4 develop trust `internal & external`

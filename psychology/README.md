### Forward Propagation Process

> [**Awareness**](#awareness) â†’ [Desire](#desire) â†’ [**Action**](#action) â†’ [**Reward**](#reward)

### Backward Propagation Process
>
> Result > [**Action**](#action) > [Diagnosis](#diagnose) > [Design](#design) > [Implementation](#implementation)
> > The reason we need practice is because the brain doesn't have NN backward propagation;
> > Learning involves neurons syncing fire timing to strengthen synapse connections. The basic form of learning is association. Once a bad habit is formed, it's very hard to change.

[**Awareness**](#awareness) and [**Action**](#action) are important factors that influence the decision process.

[Desire](#desire) and [Reward](#reward) are less in our control.

> Most of the time, the brain takes in CURRENT INPUT to decide [**CURRENT ACTION**](#action);
>
> We often forget to take PAST INPUT (**history**) to predict [**past action**](#action); then evaluate against historical records. The greatest benefit of studying history is having more data & cheaper evaluation.

> **Logic Formulary**
>
> **Current + Action = Desire**

## Psychology Definitions

### Awareness
>
> Awareness can be broken down into [**Cue**](#cue) â†’ [**Attention**](#awareness) â†’ [Sensation](psychology.md#2-sensation) â†’ [**Perception**](psychology.md#3-perception)
>
> If you lack some awareness, most likely your philosophy doesn't prioritize it.
> > Prioritize [philosophy](./experience.md#philosophy) to improve [Perception](psychology.md#3-perception).

#### Cue
>
> Any [**Perception**](./psychology.md#3-perception) that triggers a habit loop.

### Desire
>
> There is a natural psychological desire within us to **belong** and have **power**.
>
> Dopamine â‰ˆ desires; 80% of neuronal cells have receptors for dopamine.
>
> Man can do what he desires, but can't will his desire; it's easier to simply avoid the CUE that triggers desire.
>
> > Remember power comes with responsibility; ask yourself when you desire something, are you ready for responsibility.

### Reward
>
> Reward or satisfaction is DIFFERENT from desire.
>
> Serotonin â‰ˆ happiness & satisfaction.
>
> Raphe nuclei are clusters of neurons located in the brainstem that are the primary source of serotonin projections to the rest of the brain.

## Action

- 1 [Risk & Reward Analysis](experience.md#risk-reward)
  - [From Past Experience](experience.md)
  - From Logic Deduction
- 2 Choice 1 of 4 Actions
  - a: Do nothing.
    - a.1 Don't recognize the problem.
    - a.2 Ignore problem.
  - b: Avoid the problem.
    - b.1 Change path
    - b.2 Change desires
  - c: [Self improvement](#reflection).
  - d: Outsource Problem.
    - d.1 Reliance on people
    - d.2 Reliance on machine

## Reflection

### Diagnose

- 3.1 Diagnose `listen to others; reexamine experience`
  - 3.1.2 [Desire](#desire) `Belong or Power?`
    - Increase:
      - readjust personal philosophy
      - convert emotion to motivation
    - Decrease:
      - [avoid](#evaluation-2-avoid-problem)
      - power comes w responsibility
  - 3.1.2 [Awareness](#awareness)
    - [attention?](psychology.md#1-attention)
      - re-prioritize personal value;
      - improve process design;
      - more process training;
    - [sensation?](psychology.md#2-sensation)
      - any workaround? `I can't fix blind`
    - [perception?](./psychology.md#3-perception)
      - biological perception? `workaround?`
      - psychological perception? [`study mammal brain`](psychology.md#3-perception)
        - internal
        - external
  - 3.1.3 [Experience](psychology.md#4-experience)
    - Add Experience
    - Avoid Trigger
    - Edit Association
- 3.2 Validate diagnose
  - 3.2.1 start from problem
    - can you reproduce problem?
    - list out possible cause, then elimination
  - 3.2.2 start from ability
    - can you add test, logs, monitor to narrow root causes?
    - can you limit variables?
    - can you execute potential solutions to see results?

### Design

- 3.3 Communication
  - 3.3.1 Connection before correction.
    - External: confirm their feelings, share your feelings
    - Internal: trust yourself, aka [mammal brain](nervous.md#mammal-brain)
- 3.4 Design Process
  - 3.4.1 If there is another party, remember to compromise
  - 3.4.2 Solution can be incremental improvement

### Implementation

- 3.5 Training
  - 3.5.1 Confirm improvement
  - 3.5.2 Repetition is the key
- 3.6 Conclusion
  - 3.6.1 Identify problem, solution, progress, lesson
  - 3.6.2 Explore alternatives
  - 3.6.3 Document [adjustment of experience](#experience)
    - Ex: skill, conclusion, principle, personal value
  - 3.6.4 Develop trust `internal & external`

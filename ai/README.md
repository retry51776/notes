## Analogy

- AI is similar to Chemistry/Physical in 1800. There's some set logic/mechanism(usable metal); We play around data(Iron Ore) with some computation process(refine ore). Maybe the remaining data AKA model(Iron/steel) is what we desire. So value of the data is NOT determent by amount, but the data contains logic/mechanism we desires.

  > Mining & Extraction = Data Collection & Scraping
  >
  > Computation = Heat
  >
  > Data Center = Blast Furnace
  >
  > Data = Iron Ore
  >
  > Model = Iron
  >
  > Fine-Tuning (Specialized Model Training) = Alloying (Adding Carbon to Make Steel)
  >
  > Inference & Deployment = Rolling & Shaping Steel
  >
  > AI Evaluation (Benchmarks, Alignment, RLHF) = Quality Testing & Hardening
  >
  > AI Applications = Bridges, Cars, Tools
  >
  > Smart AI output token's info density = Iron density

## Frustrations

- Mechanistic Interpretability moves very slows while AI capability keep accelerating
- Tech stacks are NOT decouple, hardware & software are most likely interlock.

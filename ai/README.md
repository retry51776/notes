## Analogy

- AI today mirrors 19th‑century chemistry and metallurgy. A fixed set of principles—like the properties of usable metal—guides us as we turn raw data (iron ore) through computational “heat” into a refined steel product (the model, i.e., iron or steel). The value of the data isn’t measured by sheer quantity; it resides in the embedded logic and mechanisms that we seek.

  - Mining & Extraction → Data collection & scraping
  - Computation → Heat
  - Data center → Blast furnace
  - Data → Iron ore
  - Model → Iron (or steel)
  - Fine‑tuning / specialized model training → Alloying (adding carbon to make steel)
  - Inference & deployment → Rolling & shaping steel
  - AI evaluation (benchmarks, alignment, RLHF) → Quality testing & hardening
  - AI applications → Bridges, cars, tools
  - Smart AI output token’s information density → Iron density

## Frustrations

- Mechanistic Interpretability(mech interp) moves very slows(close source, LLM specific) while AI capability keep accelerating.
- Tech stacks are NOT decouple, hardware & software are most likely interlock.

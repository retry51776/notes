- Code

## Human ability

- Input
  - ~~Hearing~~
  - Taste `limited by hardware`
  - Smell `limited by hardware`
  - Visual Perception
    - ~~Read~~
    - ~~Body Language Perception~~
    - Surrounding Awareness `Tesla already achieved`
  - Touch `Very hard for robot`
    - pressure
    - warmth
    - cold
    - pain
  - Kinesthesis `senses body movement and position`
  - Vestibular `monitors head's position and balance`
- State
  - Continues Learning `rapid update from action & result`
  - Desire `Do we want AI to have its own desire?`
  - Understanding `AI already does; but we don't even know how the brain makes conclusions, how we judge AIs' conclusions? Is it computation or storage?`
    - holding state across time `runtime compute`
    - AI's selfâ€‘conclusion
    - human conclusion
    - physical world conclusion `will soon be better than human`
    - visual understanding `But not understood yet; one day an AI that watches all YouTube videos will be smarter than any human`
- Output
  - ~~Listen & Speak~~
  - ~~Read/Write~~
  - Taste & Smell `limited by hardware`
  - Mobility `hard to achieve, Boston Dynamics`
    - Touch `hard`
    - Proprioception `body position`
    - ~~Body Language Expression~~
    - Stamina `biology is very effective`

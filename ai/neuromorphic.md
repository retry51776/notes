> Human have 86 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections, to process related small experiences. LLM currently have 10 trillion connection to process all human writings.

> Brain uses Sparse Repr, it save energy, resilient to noise

> One major differences is NN can do backward propagation. But neuron synapse only fire single direction.

>> Also LLM can slowly adapt from same situation(same input) by repeat multiple cycles, but animals usually only experience situation once.

> Human don't receive error, we get feedback from interaction. But error can back propagation, but how to back propagation feedback? Maybe that's why positive discipline works, maybe success easier learned(back propagation) than failure. (I don't think it's success or failure matter, rather emotional level) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08747>

> There are many dimensions neuron plasticity;

**Fractals** are geometric shapes or patterns that show self-similarity across different scales.

- Neuron Synapse Length
- Neuron Oscillating Frequency

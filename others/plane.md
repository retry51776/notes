# Engine
> Turbojet `faster acceleration`
> > Compressor `compress intake air`
> > Shaft `pass rotation force to compressor`
> > Combustion chamber
> > Turbine `uses exhaust energy to turn shaft`
> > Nozzle

> Turbofan `better fuel efficiency`
> > 
- Bypass Ratio `air go though turbine vs air go though burning chamber`

# Engine

> **Turbojet** – faster acceleration  
>   - Compressor – compresses intake air  
>   - Shaft – transmits rotational force to the compressor  
>   - Combustion chamber  
>   - Turbine – uses exhaust energy to turn the shaft  
>   - Nozzle  

> **Turbofan** – better fuel efficiency  
>   - Bypass ratio: amount of air that bypasses the turbine vs. air that goes through the combustion chamber.

The major difference between a jet engine and a piston engine is that the four phases (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust) are continuous in a jet engine, whereas they are intermittent in a piston engine. Swapping these phases unnecessarily wastes time and reduces efficiency.

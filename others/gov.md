## Executive
- President  

> 1st Monday of February – President requests budget (starting Oct 1).  
> 15 April – Congress passes budget resolution (“blueprint”).  
> 15 May – Congress passes appropriations bills (“markup bill”, 12 subcommittees).  
> If appropriations are not ready by Oct 1, Congress uses a Continuing Resolution (CR) to temporarily fund the government.

## Legislative
> 35‑week session; legislation is often introduced or debated at any time.  

- Wednesday – legislative markup  
- Thursday & Friday – voting (`roll call`)

**Process:** Interest group → member of Congress → Speaker assigns to committee → committee chair decides topic → markup → committee vote → full House/Senate vote → President signs.

> Notes from *Everyday Astronaut*  

> Always start with first principles during design; ensure each component is necessary before optimizing.

## Design Process
1. Reduce constraints & requirements  
2. Delete unnecessary parts or processes  
3. Optimize remaining elements  
4. Increase production rate  
5. Automate where possible  

### Combustion Cycles
- Oxidizer‑rich staged combustion – wastes oxidizer  
- Fuel‑rich staged combustion – wastes fuel  
- Full‑flow staged combustion – most efficient, but requires advanced materials  

**Engines**
- Merlin (SpaceX)  
- Raptor 1 – 180 t thrust  
- Raptor 2 – 230–250 t thrust at 300 bar pressure (torch igniters removed)

## Components & Parts
- Oxypower head  
- Fuel power head  
- Preburner  
- Start sequence  
- Cross‑feed system  
- Combustion efficiency hardware  
- Swirl injectors  
- Actuators  
- Kerosene feed  
- Impeller  
- Engine shroud – shields engine heat and airflow  
- Powerhead – contains preburner, turbine, pump  

### Metrics
- Specific impulse (Isp)  
- Area under thrust‑vs‑time curve  
- Chamber pressure profile  

**Flow Path:** Inlet → gimbal → inducer → impeller stages → turbine.

# Rocket

> Most notes from Everyday Astronaut

> Always run through first principle during design, make sure component must exist before opimized it

1. reduce constrains & requirements
2. delete part or process
3. optimize
4. product rate
5. automate

Oxidizer-rich staged combustion `wast Ox`
Fuel-rich staged combustion `wast fuel,`
Full flow Staged `most eff, but required materiel`
Merlin 

Raptor 1 180 tons thrust
Raptor 2 230-250 tons thrust w 300 bar pressure
- Removed tortch igniters

## Componets & Parts
- oxy power head
- fuel power head
- preburner
- start sequence
- cross feed
- combustion effeciency
- swell injectors
- actuators
- kerosene
- impeller
- engine shroud `shield to block engine heat & winds`
- power head `preburner, turbine, pump`

### Metrics
- Specific impulse (ISP)
- area under forced vs time curve
- chamber pressure plot

inlet -> gimbal -> inducer -> impeller stages -> turbine

> space-time trade-off: Cool physic fact, everything "moves same speed" in space-time, speed increase will slow down time

> observable cone means the farther we see the older it gets

# Thoughts
> Is this means someone far away already seen our future? and our future already determined?

> I feel like standard model have more applications, things far away most likely won't matter. We can't even get to Mars..

> Why is space in Standard Model? I felt like Standard Model only desc how particle interact w other particles. There is got to explain why space grow & dark matter. I suspect both are  caused same physic.
# General Relativity

> The Einstein equation desc relationship between Content & Curvature
$$
R_μν − ½R  {g_μ}_ν = {8πG\over c4} T_μν
$$

- $R_μν$ `Ricci tensor curvature`
- R `Ricci scalar curvature`
- ${g_μ}_ν$ `metric tensor`
- $T_μν$ `stress-energy tensor`
- c `speed of light in a vacuum`
- G `universal gravitational constant`
- π `the famous constant from geometry`

### Energy momentum tensor
> Content of space-time, right part Einstein equation, aka mass
    constance = ${8πG\over c4} Tμν$

### Geodesics Equation 
> geometry of space-time, left part Einstein equation, aka Curvature, How obj naturally move

#### riemann curvature tensor (space curve)
  - metric tensor (calculate distance)
  - christopher symbols (how grid changes)
  - richie tensor (tool compress riemann curvature tensor)
  - richie scalar (avg curvature in all directions)


#### Calculation Metric
1. Minkowski metric `for flat space time`
2. Schwarzschild metric `for spherical mass`
3. FLRW metric
4. Morris-Thorne `wormhole`
5. kerr `black hole`

#### Calculation Coordinate
1. cartesian coordinates `Minkowski Metric`
2. Schwarzschild coordinates `Schwarzschild Metric`


# Standard Model

> Fermions = matters; 3 generation(pair quarks) & (pair lepton)
>>  1. (up/down) (electron/electron neutrinos)
>>  2. (charm/strang) (muons/muon neutrinos)
>>  3. (top/bottom) (tau/tau neutrinos)
> Bonson = Force
>>  gauge bonson
>>  - photon
>>  - gluon (strong force)
>>  - z0 w+ w- (weak force)
>>  - higgs (field create mass)

### Plaster
- Ultracal 30 `strong, can be layer, longer`
- Hydrocal `med, no layer`
- USG pottery plaster `weakest`

Bell Siphon `Using pressure to release fluid in a batch; EX: washing machine dispend washing flue;`

# Natural Gas
Transportation
- Pipe line `max length 700 miles under sea or 2200 miles on land`
- LNG `ship in super cold liquid form`

- Conventional Gas
- Unconventional Gas `biproduct of fossil fuels well`
  - Coal Seam Gas
  - shell gas

# Nuclear
> fusion
> fission
> > uranium `able to develop nuclear weapon`
> > Plutonium `by product of uranium reaction, doesn't exist naturally`
> > thorium `won't self start, won't `

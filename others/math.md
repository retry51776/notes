# Math
- Analytic continuation 解析延拓
- Index theory 指标理论

## Key assumption
> Which theorems? `Godel Incompleteness Theorems`

> What are element? How logic operation effect element? `Group theory`

> Is number continuous vs discrete?
>> discrete:
>>> Combinatorics
>>> Connection & Edge `Graph Theory`
>
>> continuous:
>>> Relationship between Change? `Calculus`

> Focus on Spaces relationship`Geometry, Topology`

> Multi POV, or without full view? `Game theory`

> Is probability inheritance through time? `Monty Hall`

## Word Def
- Principle `The underline idea/concept`
- Algorithm `The serials of steps to resolve problem`

# IMO
> Encryption just make one path much harder than other paths.

> Problem w school is they focus on algorithm(skill); but not ability to prove algorithm(principal), nor underline premise(value), nor mistakes/need that lead to this new theory/principal.

# IDK
- Topology `Connectedness, Holes, Compactness`
> Homeomorphic is sub area Topology where one object can wrap into another object;

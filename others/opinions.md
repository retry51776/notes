# Don't judge

There is no solution, only tradeoffs.

here are common trade offs
- CPU vs Memory
  - all dev knows
- Speed vs Accuracy
- Latency vs. Throughput
- consistency or availability
  - DB high avaibility problem
- features or scalebility
  - SQL vs no SQL
- complexity or flexibility
  
# Physic
- space-time trade-off: Cool physic fact, everything "moves same speed" in space-time, speed increase will slow down time

- General Relativity
```
The Einstein equation

Curvature (gerometry of space-time)

    Geodesics Equation
        - riemann curvature tensor (space curve)
            - metric tensor (calulate distance)
            - christopher symbols (how grid changes)

            # Simplefy Tools
            - richie tensor (tool compress riemann curvature tensor)
            - richie scalar (avg curvature in all directions)

**Standard Model**

```
Fermions = matters; 3 generation(pair quarks) & (pair lepton)
    1. (up/down) (electron/electron neutrinos)
    2. (charm/strang) (muons/muon neutrinos)
    3. (top/bottom) (tau/tau neutrinos)
Bonson = Force
    gauge bonson
    - photon
    - gluon (strong force)
    - z0 w+ w- (weak force)
    - higgs (field create mass)
```

Battery
- Anode : negative terminal
  - graphite, lithium
- Cathode : postive terminal
  - cobalt, nickel and manganese

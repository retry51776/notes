# Framework
> Some well know framework/relationship that can apply in different areas;

## Bio ecosystem
1. Bio diversity
2. Auto balance between hunter & pray
3. Producer -> Consumer -> xth Consumer
4. Network effect

> Tiger is very powerful, but also very limited in their living area; They must live in area w enough food support them; Everything has its constrain.

## Human brain & relationship
1. logic(slow but accurate) vs emotion(fast but guess)
2. parenting(cortex parenting cerebrum)
3. Connection before correction
4. Decision fatigue

## Discrete math
1. Proven & Disprove theory `Proposition, Negation, Conjunction ...etc`
2. Truth Table / Logic Tree
3. Boolean Logic

## Neural network
1. Loss/Mistake & forward vs backward propagation
2. Structure determent algorithm
> I wish to be expert in this area, this will reveal so much about human brain; Our main bottleneck & how to bypass them

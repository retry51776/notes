# Hardware

CPU
  - CISC
    - x86
    > Access memory prior instruction, & different instruction size, makes out of order excution hard, 

    > Variable length instructions

    > Can perform arithmetic & access memory in a instruction

    > fewer registerss

    > larger & complexer instructions

    > multi cycle instruction
  - RISC
    - MIPS
    - Arm
    - RISC5
      > Fixed Instruction Length allows preload & preprocess easy, out of order excution 

      > simple instruction & same instruction size makes decoder easy to scale

      > memory & arithmetic instructions are separate

      > more registers

      > less instruction

      > single cyle instruction

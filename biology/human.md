Older people sleep less. Maybe it relates to learning. Sleep is like committing changes in the brain. 


# Endocrine System / 内分泌系统
controls attraction, appetite, aggression
- moods
- arousal
- circadian rhythm
- metabolism
- immune system
- signal growth
- reproduction

pineal gland / 松果腺
hypothalamus / 下丘脑 `control pituitary gland`
pituitary gland / 脑下垂体 `control rest glands`
thyroid gland / 甲状腺 `metabolism`
parathyroid gland / 甲状旁腺 `calcium`
thymus / 胸腺
adrenal gland / 肾上腺 `flight or fight`
pancreas / 胰腺 `sugar level`
gonads / 性腺 `sex`

pancreas / 胰腺 produce 
   * insulin/ 胰岛素 speeds up rate cell store glucose

   * glucacon / 胰高血糖素 break down fat into glucose

HPA axis = hypothalamus -> pituitary  -> adrenal 
HPT axis = hypothalamus -> pituitary  -> thyroid 


# immune system

Lymphatic main components
lymphatic vessels 淋巴管
tonsils 扁桃体
adenoids 腺样体
thymus 胸腺
spleen 脾


phagocytes 吞噬細胞 is group defense cells
    neutrophils 中性粒细胞/最常见白细胞，死后就是pus/脓液
    macrophage 巨噬細胞 will dissemble target, and have target protein on its surface// Major Histocompatibility Complex (Similar to checksum)
    natural killer cell 自然殺手細胞
    leukocytosis 白细胞

mast cell 肥大细胞 start inflammation by produce 发热激活物（pyrogenic activator）
Histamine 组织胺 protein that causes inflammation, one of 发热激活物


Antibody 抗体/抗生素 is a protein that bonds to the target cell.
    Penicillin 青霉素 and Cephalosporin 头孢菌素stop bacteria build the cell wall
    Tetracycline 四环素 and Chloramphenicol/ 氯霉素 stop bacteria produce food
    Rifampin 利福平 is bacteria stop duplicate DNA

B Lymphocyte 淋巴细胞 is the killer cell that has thousands antibody on its surface. It runs around the bloodstream to detect an intruder. Then multiply itself with the only antibody that bonds to the intruder.
B Cell antibody is generated randomly, so its antibody must be confirmed with T cell before mass production.

Thyus Lymphocyte 淋巴细胞 breaks into
     Helper T Cell is controller cell, activity Cytotoxic T Cell, training B Cell
     Cytotoxic T Cell is a killer cell

Check & balance of B & T Lymphicyte is important

# Memory Types
- Semantic Memory `knowledge`
- Episodic Memory `Remember events`
- Procedural Memory `How to do things`

# Hormones
> produces by gland
GABA - stop electric signal pass between neuron; opposite to Dopamine
Dopamine(多巴胺) - active agent, lack will cause shaking
Serotonin(血清素) - Happy, memory
Prolactin(泌乳素) - Produce milk
Luteinizing Hormones (黄体化激素) - Ovaries
Follicle Stimulating Hormones (卵泡刺激素) - pubertal development
Oxytocin() - Love
Melatonin - Clock, Sleep
Endorphins - Pain killer
Adrenaline - fight or flight
Norepinephrine - redirect blood in dangerous

# Nervous System
- Central Nervous System (CNS)
  - Brain
  - Spinal Cord
- Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
  - Somatic Nervous System `voluntary`
  - Autonomic Nervous System `involuntary`
    - Sympathetic Nervous System `Arousing`
      - spin core -> preganglionic cell -> ganglion -> postganglionic cell -> organ
    - Parasympathetic Nervous System `Calming`

> Both Neutotransmitter and hormones effects neuron, sometime even same compound.
> > I think of both Neutotransmitter and hormones are message broker system`rabbitmq` in programming, each organ has it own consumer`receptor` listen to message and will response according its consumer; hormones is fanout exchange, deliver through blood; while neutotransmitter is topic exchange deliver to specific organ
**Neutotransmitter** `ferry signal to another neuron; most neuron works with single type Neutotransmitter`
- Acetylcholine (ACH)
- Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) `30% neuron, suppress`
- Norepinephrine `suppress; excite heart for alertness`
- Dopamine `suppress;`

## Analogy
>
> Just distinct biology features reminds me programming terms;

> Human have about 200 distinct cell types;

> Aging is NOT because DNA corruption, rather DNA corruption trigger repairing DNA have strong side effect to DNA packing;
> > DNA is cookbook; Ribosome is reader; Histones & chromatin fiber & other Cell Molecules are bookmarks; Damage is not cookbook text, nor reader; Rather bookmarks on cookbook may moved to wrong spot;

## RNA
>
> RNA, or ribonucleic acid, plays several roles in biology, including coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. Here are the main types of RNA:

- Messenger RNA (mRNA): These molecules carry the genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where proteins are synthesized.

- Transfer RNA (tRNA): These molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis. They are key players in the translation of the genetic code into proteins.

- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): These molecules, along with proteins, make up the ribosomes, the organelles that translate the mRNA into protein.

- Small Nuclear RNA (snRNA): These molecules, in the form of complexes called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), are involved in splicing, a process that removes introns from pre-mRNA.

- Small Nucleolar RNA (snoRNA): These molecules are primarily involved in the modification of other RNAs, mainly rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs.

- MicroRNA (miRNA): These are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, often by binding to and leading to the degradation of target mRNAs.

- Small Interfering RNA (siRNA): These molecules are involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where they interfere with the expression of specific genes.

- Piwi-Interacting RNA (piRNA): These molecules interact with Piwi proteins and protect the integrity of the genome in germ cells.

- Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNA): These are a diverse class of RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins but have various regulatory roles.

- Circular RNA (circRNA): These are a type of non-coding RNA which, unlike other RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop and are associated with gene regulation in the cytoplasm and potentially in the nucleus.

- Enhancer RNA (eRNA): These are a type of non-coding RNA produced at enhancer sites, and they play a role in gene expression regulation.

## Analogy
>
> Distinct biology features remind me of programming terms;
>
> Humans have about 200 distinct cell types;
>
> Aging is **not** caused by DNA corruption; rather, DNA corruption triggers repair mechanisms that have strong side effects on DNA packing.
> > DNA is a cookbook; ribosome is the reader; histones, chromatin fiber, and other cellular molecules are bookmarks. Damage is not text in the cookbook nor the reader; instead, bookmarks in the cookbook may be moved to the wrong spot.

- Genome
  - DNA `Blueprint; Not reservable change; aka Source Code;`
    - Chromosome `Thread‑like structures; Human has 46 chromosomes`
      - Gene `Section of DNA that creates a protein; aka Class or Function;`
- Epigenomes `Beyond genetics; Reservable change; aka CI/CD;`
  - Transcription `DNA to RNA; aka CI;`
    - RNA `.pyc file, compiled Python code;`
      - MicroRNA `Very short RNA that, in the current growth stage, attaches to the next‑stage RNA, preventing its translation into protein. Aka exclusion resource lock.`
    - Chromatin fiber `Chains histones/chromatin together`
    - Histones `Proteins around which DNA is wrapped; control gene accessibility; aka archive source code;`
      - Concentration of cellular molecules `Environment variable`
      - Molecules wrapping DNA `Packing logic`
- Translation `RNA to protein; aka CD;`
  - Ribosome `Python runtime; reads three RNA bases to produce one amino acid;`
  - Protein `Molecules made from 20 amino acids`
  - Enzymes `Helper methods`
- Cell `Class`
- Hormone `Redux action event`
- Hormone receptors `Redux event reducer`

- Regulatory Gene `webpack`

## RNA
>
> RNA, or ribonucleic acid, plays several roles in biology, including coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. Here are the main types of RNA:

- Messenger RNA (mRNA): Carries genetic information from DNA in the nucleus to ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where proteins are synthesized.
- Transfer RNA (tRNA): Brings amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis; it is a key player in translating the genetic code into proteins.
- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): Together with proteins, forms ribosomes, the organelles that translate mRNA into protein.
- Small Nuclear RNA (snRNA): Forms small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and is involved in splicing, which removes introns from pre‑mRNA.
- Small Nucleolar RNA (snoRNA): Primarily involved in modifying other RNAs, mainly rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs.
- MicroRNA (miRNA): Small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post‑transcriptionally, often by binding to target mRNAs and leading to their degradation.
- Small Interfering RNA (siRNA): Participates in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, interfering with the expression of specific genes.
- Piwi‑Interacting RNA (piRNA): Interacts with Piwi proteins and protects genome integrity in germ cells.
- Long Non‑Coding RNA (lncRNA): A diverse class of RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins but have various regulatory roles.
- Circular RNA (circRNA): Forms a covalently closed continuous loop; associated with gene regulation in the cytoplasm and potentially in the nucleus.
- Enhancer RNA (eRNA): Produced at enhancer sites and plays a role in regulating gene expression.

# Anatomy

> Study of the human body。
>
> > The problem is that the human body often performs multiple functions, which cannot be easily organized into distinct systems.

## Programming Analogy

Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ System → Organism  
statement → method → class → package → program

### Key Systems

- [Nervous System](../psychology/nervous.md) `aka how the brain works`
- [Circulatory System](#circulatory-system)
  - Respiratory System
  - [Lymphatic System](#lymphatic-system)
- [Digestive System](#digest-system)
- Muscular System
  - Reproductive System

## Nervous System
>
> The [Nervous System](../psychology/nervous.md) is similar to a road system. There is a City (Neocortex), Express Toll (PNS), Highway Enter & Exit Ramp (Basal Ganglia), Highway (Spinal Cord), and Normal Road (Circulatory System).

## Circulatory System

Main components:

- Heart
- Blood vessels `which include arteries, veins, and capillaries`
- Blood `made up of red and white blood cells, plasma, and platelets`

## Endocrine System
>
> The endocrine system (`内分泌系统`) controls attraction, appetite, and aggression.
>
> Glands produce hormones; hormones travel through the bloodstream, then bind to hormone receptors to enter cells.

### Glands

Functions include:

- Mood regulation
- Arousal
- Circadian rhythm
- Metabolism
- Immune system modulation
- Growth signaling
- Reproduction

Organs:

- Pineal gland / 松果腺
- Hypothalamus / 下丘脑 `controls pituitary gland`
- Pituitary gland / 脑下垂体 `controls other glands`
- Thyroid gland / 甲状腺 `metabolism`
- Parathyroid gland / 甲状旁腺 `calcium regulation`
- Thymus / 胸腺
- Adrenal gland / 肾上腺 `fight‑or‑flight response`
- Pancreas / 胰腺 `blood‑sugar regulation`
- Gonads / 性腺 `sex hormones`

#### Pancreas Products

- Insulin (`胰岛素`) speeds up cellular glucose uptake.

- Glucagon (`胰高血糖素`) breaks down fat into glucose.

> HPA axis = hypothalamus → pituitary → adrenal  
> HPT axis = hypothalamus → pituitary → thyroid

### Hormones
>
> Produced by glands; `I think of hormones as massagers`.

- GABA – stops electrical signals between neurons; opposite to dopamine.
- Dopamine (多巴胺) – activates pathways; deficiency can cause tremors.
- Serotonin (血清素) – mood and memory.
- Prolactin (泌乳素) – milk production.
- Luteinizing Hormone (黄体化激素) – acts on ovaries.
- Follicle‑Stimulating Hormone (卵泡刺激素) – drives pubertal development.
- Oxytocin – love and bonding.
- Melatonin – circadian clock, sleep.
- Endorphins – natural painkillers.
- Adrenaline – fight‑or‑flight response.
- Norepinephrine – redirects blood flow in danger.

> Both neurotransmitters and hormones affect neurons; sometimes the same compound does both.  
> I think of them as a message‑broker system (`rabbitmq`) in programming: each organ has its own consumer (receptor) that listens to messages and responds accordingly. Hormones act like a fan‑out exchange delivered through blood, while neurotransmitters are more like topic exchanges delivering to specific targets.

**Neurotransmitter** `ferry signals between neurons; most neurons use a single type of neurotransmitter`

- Acetylcholine (ACh)
- Gamma‑aminobutyric acid (GABA) – present in ~30 % of neurons, suppresses activity
- Norepinephrine – can both suppress and excite the heart for alertness
- Dopamine – modulates reward pathways

## Lymphatic System

`淋巴系统`

Lymphatic vessels pump about 15 % of interstitial fluid back into the bloodstream.

> Most other proteins, sugars, and waste travel through capillaries `aka “walk on road”`; then they move through cells `aka “off‑road”` to organs.  
> Red blood cells are like trucks carrying **oxygen** in capillaries `aka roads`.

Components:

- Lymphatic vessels 淋巴管
- Tonsils 扁桃体
- Adenoids 腺样体
- Thymus 胸腺
- Spleen 脾

Immunity components:

- Phagocytes 吞噬细胞 – group defense cells  
  - Neutrophils 中性粒细胞 – most common white blood cell; after death they become pus.  
  - Macrophages 巨噬细胞 – disassemble targets and display target proteins on their surface (major histocompatibility complex, similar to a checksum).  
  - Natural killer cells 自然杀手细胞
- Mast cells 肥大细胞 – start inflammation by producing pyrogenic activators.  
- Histamine 组织胺 – protein that causes inflammation.

- Antibodies 抗体/抗生素 – proteins that bind to target cells.  
  - Penicillin 青霉素 and Cephalosporin 头孢菌素 stop bacteria from building cell walls.  
  - Tetracycline 四环素 and Chloramphenicol 氯霉素 inhibit bacterial protein synthesis.  
  - Rifampin 利福平 stops bacterial DNA replication.

> B lymphocytes are killer cells that display thousands of antibodies on their surface. They circulate in the bloodstream to detect intruders, then proliferate with the specific antibody needed.  
> B‑cell antibodies are generated randomly and must be validated by T cells before mass production.

- **T lymphocytes**  
  - Helper T cells – coordinate activity, activate cytotoxic T cells, and train B cells.  
  - Cytotoxic T cells – kill infected or malignant cells.

Balancing B‑ and T‑cell responses is crucial.

## Digestive System
>
> The digestive system breaks food into three categories:

- Fat
- Protein
- Carbohydrate  
  - Fructose is directly metabolized in the blood.  
  - Glucose and alcohol follow similar metabolic pathways.

## Maintenance

- Heartflow Test `aka “inject dye, then CT scan to see blood flow in the heart”`
- Chanca Piedra – kidney‑stone breaker
- Calcium Coronary Scan `test before Heartflow Test`
- Prophylactic statin – reduces LDL cholesterol in blood

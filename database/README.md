# Database

> Perspective of an application developer.

## TODO

- Common DB data structures (e.g., B‑tree)  
- Common algorithms  
- Typical bad queries & fixes  
- Trade‑offs of different databases  

## Considerations

- Data structure  
- Data volume  
- Ephemeral “last very short” data  
- Latency tolerance  
- Security  
- Aggregation & query demand  

## NoSQL Databases

- **Bloom filter** – a probabilistic algorithm that determines whether an element is *possibly* in a set or definitely not. It hashes elements into a bit array; checking involves testing the relevant bits.

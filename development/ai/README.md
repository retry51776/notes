# AI
> I think the fundamental idea of AI is past determent future.
> > What I mean is AI extract pattern from past data, assumes those pattern will most likely works in future problem.


## Hardware
- near memory design:
- reconfigurable dataflow hardware vs parallelism on top of existing computation

> At the end of the day, only limitation is space; space either assign to computation(flexible or efficiency) or storage(latency or throughput);

## Basic Terms:
- Learning Workflow
  - Forward Propagation
  - Backward Propagation
    - Lost
- Neuron `fundamental unit in a neural network that performs a simple mathematical operation on input data and passes the result to other neurons or output units`
  - Activation function
  - Weight
  - Bias `a value that is added to the output of a neuron before it is passed to the next layer.`
- Prompt Engineering `aka use beginning statement to set context for AI`

## Architecture
> Think of AI as a kid, we are designing games to see which game `architecture` help AI `kid` grow;

- Stable diffusion: add noise to image, let AI recover image;

- Language Model is statical model of large text db. AI usually very agreeable/static basie.


## Cool AIs
- CodeFormer `Image/movie recover & enhance AI`
- ChatGPT `Everyone knows`
- Quillbot `Rephrase text`
- https://beta.elevenlabs.io/voice-lab


## IMO
- There isn't a correct hidden state, rather these problem has similar feature sets. `CNN first layer recognized edges, then lines, then organs.`


- List of Human ability/skills that AI need to learn
  - Not much progress
    - Desire `do we want AI has its own desire?`
    - Taste & Smell `it's hardware thing, very hard`

  - In progress to match human
    - Mobility `hard to achieve, Boston Dynamics`
        - Touch `hard`
        - Proprioception `body position`
        - Body Language Expression `latency problem`
        - Stamina `easy, just different energy source`
    - Understanding `AI already does; But we don't even know how brain makes conclusion, how we jude AIs' conclusions? Is it computation or storage?`
      - AIs self conclusion
      - human conclusion
      - physical world conclusion `will soon better than human`
      - visual understanding `But not understand yet; One day a AI watch all Youtube Videos will smarter than any human`

  - Better than human `AI has hardware advantage over human`
    - Visual Perception
        - Body Language Perception
        - Surrounding Awareness `Tesla already achieved`
    - Listen & Speak
    - Read/Write
- Biology System AIs doesn't need
  - Digest System
  - Circulation System
  - Nociception `pain`


> > IMO: most important in AI is right question `aka desire` & measurement of progress `aka value`.

> We are environment feedback; AI is same; AI can easily traversal through digital world; But in physical world, AI will just be like us, only experience subset of reality. AI most likely will experience more than any single human, but AI still limited by its experience ability.
> > Most important thing is feedback system.

> People lives in a house; Sames for AI, AI lives on hardware; Some AI can squeeze in small PC, of course can't do as much.

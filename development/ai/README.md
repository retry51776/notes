# AI

## Hardware
- near memory design:

## Basic Terms:
- Learning Workflow
  - Forward Propagation
  - Backward Propagation
    - Lost
- Neuron `fundamental unit in a neural network that performs a simple mathematical operation on input data and passes the result to other neurons or output units`
  - Activation function
  - Weight
  - Bias `a value that is added to the output of a neuron before it is passed to the next layer.`

## architecture
> Think of AI as a kid, we are designing games to see which game `architecture` help AI `kid` grow;

- Stable diffusion: add noise to image, let AI recover image;

# Development

Both software and hardware improvements are similar.

- Cache
  - Capacity
  - Latency
  - Throughput
- Computation
  - Parallel `increase workers`
  - Interrupt `swap tasks to increase hardware efficiency`
  - Predict `trade/waste computation for speed`
  - Arithmetic
  - in-place execution `avoid intermediate variables`

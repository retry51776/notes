# Math
- Analytic continuation 解析延拓
- Index theory 指标理论

## Key assumption
> Which theorems? `Godel Incompleteness Theorems`

> What are element? How logic operation effect element? `Group theory`

> Is number continuous vs discrete?
>> discrete:
>>> Combinatorics
>>> Connection & Edge `Graph Theory`
>
>> continuous:
>>> Relationship between Change? `Calculus`

> Focus on Spaces relationship`Geometry, Topology`

> Multi POV, or without full view? `Game theory`

> Is probability inheritance through time? `Monty Hall`

> Complex Variable is design to map states that in a loop.
## Word Def
- Principle `The underline idea/concept`
- Algorithm `The serials of steps to resolve problem`

# IMO
> Encryption just make one path much harder than other paths.
> > Will increase action space good enough to protect secrets? AI seems have stronger ability to run through large action space than human.

> Problem w school is they focus on algorithm(skill); but not ability to prove algorithm(principal), nor underline premise(value), nor mistakes/need that lead to this new theory/principal.
 
> Calculus is focus on relationship. Instead geometry only focus on number answer.

## Prime
> x/ln(x) > prime_count > Gauss's Conjecture 1/log(x)


## Complex Number
i * x = flip x 90 degree in complex plane;

rotate 30 degress = cos(pi/6) + i * sin(pi/6)


# Classes
`aka my wish list; I'm not good w math, but I think there are many useful principals/idea from advance math courses;`
- Topology `Connectedness, Holes, Compactness`
> Homeomorphic is sub area Topology where one object can wrap into another object;

- Partial Differential Equations (PDE)
- Advanced Calculus
- Number Theory
- Graph Theory
- Abstract Algebra `aka advance stuff`
- Cryptography

- Index theory 指标理论  

## Key Assumptions

> **Which theorems?** `Gödel Incompleteness Theorems`

> **What are elements? How do logical operations affect elements?** `Group Theory`

> **Is a number continuous or discrete?**

>> **Discrete:**  
>>>
>>> - Combinatorics  
>>> - Connections & Edges – `Graph Theory`

>> **Continuous:**  
>>>
>>> - Relationship between change – `Calculus`

> **Focus on relationships of spaces** – `Geometry, Topology`

> **Multiple points of view, or a single incomplete view?** `Game Theory`

> **Is probability inherited through time?** `Monty Hall Problem`

> **Complex variables are designed to map states that form loops.**

## Word Definitions

- **Principle** – *the underlying idea or concept*  
- **Algorithm** – *a series of steps to solve a problem*

## Symbols

- Expectation value in physics: $\langle A \rangle = \langle \psi | A | \psi \rangle.$

## Statistics

Probability distributions:

- Normal Distribution (Gaussian)
- Bernoulli Distribution (unbalanced Gaussian)  
- Exponential Distribution  
- Binomial Distribution – `individual events combined`  
- Poisson Distribution – `events occurring within a period`  
- Uniform Distribution – `continuous variable`  
- Gamma Distribution  
- Beta Distribution  
- Log‑Normal Distribution (effects compound multiplicatively)

**L2 regularization** (`Ridge regression`) enforces a smooth slope.

## IMO

> Encryption creates one path that is much harder to traverse than other paths.  

> Will increasing the action space be sufficient to protect secrets? AI appears capable of exploring large action spaces more effectively than humans.

> The problem with school curricula is that they focus on algorithms (skills) but not on the ability to **prove** algorithms (principles), nor on underlying premises (values), nor on the mistakes or needs that lead to new theories and principles.

> Calculus focuses on relationships, whereas geometry often concentrates on numerical answers.

## Prime Numbers

> \(\displaystyle \frac{x}{\ln x} < \pi(x) < \text{Gauss's conjecture } \frac{x}{\log x}\)

## Complex Numbers

- \(i \times x\) rotates \(x\) by 90° in the complex plane.  
- Rotating 30°: \(\cos(\pi/6) + i \sin(\pi/6)\).

# Classes (Wish List)

*I’m not strong in mathematics, but I think many advanced concepts are useful.*

- **Topology** – Connectedness, holes, compactness  
  > *Homeomorphic* is a sub‑area of topology where one object can be continuously deformed into another.

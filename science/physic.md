# Physics

> **Space‑time trade‑off:** Everything moves at the same speed in space‑time; increasing spatial speed slows down time.  
> *Apple does not fall because it moves toward Earth; rather, space‑time brings both together.*

> An observable cone means that the farther we see, the older the light we receive.

## Thoughts

- What really is spacetime? Why does it have a single direction? *Is it truly unidirectional, or do we only perceive forward?*  
- Is space expanding, or is the redshift of light merely an observational effect?

- Does this imply that someone far away has already seen our future, and that our future is predetermined?

- I feel the Standard Model has many applications, but distant phenomena may not matter to us. We can’t even reach Mars yet.

- Why does space appear in the Standard Model? The model describes how particles interact, but it doesn’t explain why space expands or what dark matter is. I suspect both arise from the same physics.

- General relativity is a top‑down theory: it analyzes reality as a whole before breaking it down.  
  Conventional physics is bottom‑up: it studies the smallest components first, then builds up to larger structures.

- Physics requires complex numbers because observable reality may be only a subdomain of all possible realities (not necessarily a multiverse). I believe there is a universal rule, but we are confined to a specific “hard‑coded” version.

## General Relativity

> The Einstein equation describes the relationship between **content** and **curvature**:

\[
R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R\, g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu}
\]

- \(R_{\mu\nu}\) – Ricci tensor (curvature)  
- \(R\) – Ricci scalar curvature  
- \(g_{\mu\nu}\) – Metric tensor  
- \(T_{\mu\nu}\) – Stress‑energy tensor  
- \(c\) – Speed of light in vacuum  
- \(G\) – Gravitational constant  
- \(\pi\) – The famous geometric constant  

### Energy–Momentum Tensor
> Represents the content of space‑time (mass‑energy).  
Constant factor: \(\displaystyle \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu}\)

### Geodesic Equation
> Describes how objects move naturally in curved space‑time (the left side of Einstein’s equation).

#### Riemann Curvature Tensor (space curvature)
- Metric tensor – calculates distances  
- Christoffel symbols – describe how the coordinate grid changes  
- Ricci tensor – contraction of the Riemann tensor  
- Ricci scalar – average curvature in all directions  

#### Common Metrics
1. Minkowski metric – flat space‑time  
2. Schwarzschild metric – spherical mass  
3. FLRW metric – expanding universe  
4. Morris–Thorne metric – wormholes  
5. Kerr metric – rotating black holes  

#### Coordinate Systems
1. Cartesian coordinates – used with the Minkowski metric  
2. Schwarzschild coordinates – used with the Schwarzschild metric  

## Standard Model

> **Fermions** = matter (three generations of quark and lepton pairs)  
>> 1. Up/Down quarks, electron/electron neutrino  
>> 2. Charm/Strange quarks, muon/muon neutrino  
>> 3. Top/Bottom quarks, tau/tau neutrino  

> **Bosons** = forces  
>> Gauge bosons:  
>>> - Photon (electromagnetic)  
>>> - Gluon (strong force)  
>>> - \(Z^0\), \(W^\pm\) (weak force)  
>>> - Higgs boson (field that gives particles mass)

Strong force may have contributed to cosmic inflation. In the early universe, the four fundamental forces were independent in this order: gravity → strong → weak → electromagnetism.

### Plaster Types
- **Ultracal 30** – strong, can be layered, long‑lasting  
- **Hydrocal** – medium strength, not suitable for layering  
- **USG pottery plaster** – weakest  

**Bell siphon:** Uses pressure to release fluid in a batch (e.g., washing machine discharge).

### Natural Gas
- **Transportation**
  - Pipeline – up to 700 mi under sea or 2,200 mi on land  
  - LNG – shipped as super‑cold liquid  

- **Types**
  - Conventional gas  
  - Unconventional gas (by‑product of fossil fuel wells)  
    - Coal seam gas  
    - Shale gas  

### Nuclear Energy
- **Fusion** – merging atoms  
  - By laser → creates high pressure (“small bomb”)  
  - By electric field → requires higher temperature  

- **Fission** – splitting atoms  
  - Uranium – can be used for nuclear weapons  
  - Plutonium – by‑product of uranium reactions, not found naturally  
  - Thorium – fertile (can be converted to fissile material)  

**Small Modular Reactors (SMR)** are compact nuclear reactors designed for flexible deployment.
